It appears that what I do for a living is established enough to support parasitic 'ologies'. It's incontravertably so when induhviduals can produce the following, without a trace of irony, or embarassment:

> “*New sources of value are laying the groundwork for an entirely new media value chain; one which leverages micromedia to deliver personalized, post-branded attentionstreams of chunked and microchunked disposable and essential media to communities of connected yet ever more hyperpolarized consumers*.”

This microchunk leverages your collective attentionstream to homogenize \[y\]our hyperpolarized community into a vast post-post-branded collective intentionality of ridicule.

Or, in other words, they said: "*lotsa blogs lately*", and I said: "*bollox*".
