I spent years bemoaning the fact that the laws of physics didn't allow the wireless transmission of power. Now it seems that I bemoaned prematurely. Researchers at MIT have a [found a way](http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/18836/) to use inductance to power a 60W (think similar power rating to a laptop) lightbulb from a distance of up to 2 metres.

I Â know it doesn't sound like much, but as I look at my desk I can't help thinking that a short range power transmitter would help. I'm sure it beats Quartz crystals as a source of magic moonbeams as well.
