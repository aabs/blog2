Some time back I wrote  a [quote of the day](http://industrialinference.com/2005/12/02/quote-of-the-day-3/): *There is no greater joy than soaring high on the wings of your dreams, except maybe the joy of watching a dreamer who has nowhere to land but in the ocean of reality.* For a moment I though the quote was apropos for Alec Clew's announcement of his apostasy, but after a moment's reflection I realize that it's not.

Alec [wrote](http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2007/06/24/i-might-have-to-go-back-to-the-dark-side/) the other day that, due to driver problems, he was thinking that he may have to depart the sunlit pastures of Gnu/Linux to return to the dreary halls of Windows XP. If you've noticed any of the censure I've directed towards Alec's perverse habits (disgusting admissions of Ubuntism and flagrantly exhibitionist open-sourcism) over the last year, then you might think that there would be a spiteful little gleam in my eye. But I have admit I'm saddened. We are nearly at a point where we can perform painless .NET development entirely within a Gnu/Linux environment. It would be a sad thing if that were not possible because of hardware support shortcomings, rather than the quality of the toolset (which should be the only deciding factor).
