The third release of LinqToRdf has been uploaded to GoogleCode. Go to the [project web site](http://code.google.com/p/linqtordf) for links to the latest release.

LinqToRdf Changes:
- support for SPARQL type casting
- numerous bug fixes
- better support for identity projections
- more SPARQL relational operators
- latest versions of SemWeb & SPARQL Engine, incorporating recent bug
fixes and enhancements of each of them

I have also released a new graphical designer to auto-generate C\# entity models as well as N3 ontology specifications from UML-like designs. This new download is an extension to Visual Studio 2008 beta 2, and should make working with LinqToRdf easier for those who are not that familiar with the W3 Semantic Web specifications.

Please let me know how you get on with them.
