I'll be doing a short introduction on LINQ tonight at the [Dev SIG of Victoria.NET](http://www.victoriadotnet.com.au/vic-victorianet-dev-sig-formed/vic-victorianet-dev-sig-events.aspx) in Collins Street. I only have 20 minutes to talk so I won't be able to go into too much depth. What I do hope to do is persuade the audience that LINQ is worthy of their attention. If I can persuade a few people to go out and develop their own query providers, then even better.

It's an over capacity crowd, and they're not taking any more RSVPs. If you haven't booked yet, don't despair - I'm sure that there'll be more good stuff coming down the line.

Wish me luck - it's my first presentation for Victoria.NET.
