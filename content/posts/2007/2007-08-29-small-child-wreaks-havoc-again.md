Never leave your laptop unattended. If you do, your son will convert this:

into this:

My son is a living embodiment of the second law of thermodynamics.Â And is attracted to buttons and keyboards in the same way that a moth is attracted to a flame.

Thankfully, he doesn't know how to hit the save button yet.
