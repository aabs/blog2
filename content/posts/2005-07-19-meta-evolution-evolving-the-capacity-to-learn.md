The real value of a language learning (or any other kind of learning) organ, as Chomsky called it, is that its most valuable output is the \_capacity\_ to be so sensitive to the environment that mental processes grow to represent it. That is, the diversity of environments that humans find themselves in is so rich and varied that a hard wired and inflexible capacity would be of limited value compared to a "meta-learning" facility that develops to represent the environment the organism finds itself in.

Meta-evolution would be of more evolutionary value than just plain evolution - a learning capacity that can evolve in the real-time of an organism's life seems more valuable than the simple evolution of a set of skills and competences that must be evolved over time as environments change.
