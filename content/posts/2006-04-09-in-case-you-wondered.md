... I decided to go the whole Web2.0 hog, and post all of my new http://del.icio.us/aabs links to my blog. This is a nice little experimental feature with delicious, that will post new links up at midnight every day (assuming there are any).
I shall have to make sure that only the choicest links are served up for your browsing pleasure.
