Last week I mentioned that I was starting a rewrite of Fishdots. Well, a few of the plugins have now been ported over to the new instance of FD, which from now on I will call fd2.

They are:

- **aabs/fish_checklists**

    A fish plugin supporting production of event based checklists

- **aabs/fish_git**

    Simple fish plugin with some helpful git abbrs and functions

- **aabs/fish_subcmd**

    Fish shell plugin providing functions to set up multi-level commands (like git)

- **aabs/fish_projects**

    A simple project utility for those that work on many projects at the same time (from aabs/fishdots_projects)

- **aabs/fish_notes**

    fish plugin for managing text notes

- **aabs/fish_tmux**

    A simple fish plugin with tmux helpers

- **aabs/fish_tech**

    A plugin for fish shell to quickly jump to tech specific folders in a dev tree.

These are the plug-ins that I find most useful from day to day.  As I need them, I will convert over the other old fishdots plug-ins to the new framework.

Please let me know if you use any of these plug-ins, and whether you think they are useful or could stand to be improved.
