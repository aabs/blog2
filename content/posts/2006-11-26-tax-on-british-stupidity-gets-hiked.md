According to this BBC [report](http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/2/hi/business/6163700.stm), the UK economy is losing billions to those Nigerian scams. Even though I don't need to explain which scams to those of you who read this - they are proverbial - there are unspeakably avaricious and gullible cretins out there who still send their money into the Nigerian black economy.

I suppose if these people are moronic enough to think that the son/daughter of the Nigerian Mister for transport/embezzlement/finance  would single them out from the billions of other candidates to share their booty with, then they deserve what they get.

Besides, it's more sociable than playing on slot machines, or having your mobile stolen - you get to exchange emails with these nice but desperate scions of once great African families.
