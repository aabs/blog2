Well, [LinkMe](http://www.linkme.com.au) is coming to an end. Not literally - just my involvement in it. Yes, I am off again to a new place. This time it is [Readify](http://www.readify.com/) - a smallish consultancy that specialises in emerging .NET technologies. They were recommended to me by [Frank Arrigo](http://blogs.msdn.com/frankarr/default.aspx), the group manager of the Microsoft Australian Evangelists, who rated them as an 'elite team'. Hopefully, now I will get an opportunity to indulge my secret fetish. I am an EARLY-ADOPTER! There, it's said, I'm out of the closet now.

Microsoft Australian Evangelists - sounds like a good name for a gospel-rock group...
