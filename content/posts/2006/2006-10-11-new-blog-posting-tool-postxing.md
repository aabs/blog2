Here is a nice thing. A blog posting tool called PostXING.

Alledgedly it has source code formatting built into it. Lets give it a
try.

      public void OnChooseSomething()
      {
        IsChosen = true;
        if(ChooseThingClicked != null)
          ChooseThingClicked(this, null);
      }

Sweet. It has [CodeHTMLer](http://puzzleware.net/codehtmler/default.aspx) built in.
You just hit the syntax highlight button and away it goes:
