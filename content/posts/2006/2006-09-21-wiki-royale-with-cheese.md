For the edification of the collective attentionstream, I have decided to quote for you the ineffable value additions and polysyllabic formulations of the "*System One"* post-microchunked formats - with a translation.

"*Our* [*services*](http://www.systemone.at/en/services/) *strategically develop your organization's knowledge as a production factor in order to make optimal use of it. The core of our service portfolio is a* [*technological platform*](http://www.systemone.at/en/technology/overview/)*,   that consistently makes available innovations in the areas of* [*Social Software*](http://www.systemone.at/en/technology/socialsoftware/)*,  *[*Semantic Web*](http://www.systemone.at/en/technology/semweb/)*  and  *[*Information Retrieval*](http://www.systemone.at/en/technology/ai/)*.*"

This is undoubtedly groundbreaking stuff. In case you didn't catch it the first time round: "*we've got a website. You can use it. People can read it.*"

Awesome. Really.

Needless to say, it's french - they first brought us post-modernist analysis, and now they have brought us post-technological production factors.
