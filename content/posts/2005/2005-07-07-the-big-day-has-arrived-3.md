Well, it's all out there in the public domain now. Yayyy!!!!!

I've created a project up on sourceforge, and advertised there for help with documentation, installers and general app developers. I've uploaded an initial source code release - and configured my paypal settings.

I can't wait to see how it is received by the public. Pay the site a visit, and let me know what YOU think. And, of course, if you want to make a donation... ;o)

Here's the [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/aabsdbc/) link.
