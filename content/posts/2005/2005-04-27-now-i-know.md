... why people are so keen to be famous:

*Because when you're famous you can burn your bridges*.

I happen to want to burn mine so much right now, that I could spit! What was I thinking? Tomorrow would have been my last day. It still could be, but I can't just walk out, cos that would mean I might get a bad reference, which I can't afford.

***Grrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!***
