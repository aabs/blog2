Well, then end of another contract looms. Telstra have been my "*hosts*" for the last few months. I would like to believe that it has not been a parasitic relationship. A parasite is "*an organism that grows, feeds, and is sheltered on or in a different organism while contributing nothing to the survival of its host*". Sadly though, I must admit that, try as I might, I was able to contribute little more than a few (beautifully typeset) documents that were promptly applauded then ignored. I did not grow. If anything I shrank during this contract.

Ah well, if all goes according to plan, I shall join the evil empire.
