We had a visitor the other night. A Ring-tailed Possum. This little fellow has
been creeping around on our roof lately. That wouldn't bother me too much except
for the fact that we have a tin roof, and he has sharp clicky little claws.

Beautiful looking creatures though. And we shall have to keep a supply of
bananas around the house. Maybe we can domesticate him...
