I got the following in an email disclaimer that foreshadows interesting times ahead:

*This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed.*

Sounds like humans are only part of the game these days, and "*entities*" will be asserting their rights more forcefully in future. Perhaps such entities represent affiliated groups of humans, but perhaps they represent other semi-sentient information agregates such as software agents or epi-phenomena growing out there on the web as viruses or telephone exchanges?

One Question - How many of you reading this fall into the non-human category?

Thanks to GlennD for this signpost to the future
