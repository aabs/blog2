title: A GitHub repo template for creating Fisher plugins
---

Fishdots has grown so much that it's taking up too much space, and shell load
time is getting unweildy. So, I've started a rewrite, based on the standard
approach for autoloading using the plugin layout recommended by
[fisher plugin manager](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher). That means a
whole bunch of new repos, and probably some refactoring for fishdots.

I've created a [Fisher plugin template](https://github.com/aabs/fisher-plugin) to use as the basis for each of the plugins I rewrite.

I will be using this a lot. Feel free to do the same.
