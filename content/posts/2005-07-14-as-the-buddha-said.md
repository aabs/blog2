...life is pain.

And it seems that some of us (and I'm including myself in this camp till proven otherwise) are born with an inherited tendency to feel more pain than others. This curse is known as "*primary erythromelalgia*". And is somehow related to a defective sodium channel in the pain signalling neurons. I blame my parents.

It seems that one of the guys that I'm working with has a father-in-law who was a body guard for Adolph Hitler. A nasty bast\*rd by all accounts.
