But I was just testing whether Word 2007 is actually able to initiate the upload of a new blog post. It seems to me that it might be able to refresh an existing blog entry on wordpress, but beyond that it reports false positives. Of course, if you read this post, then you can disregard all of the above as blatant slander.

Update: yes, word posts OK to Wordpress, but it uses the default value for DateTime jan 1st 1970. So you have to manually enter the timestamp within WordPress. You also have to set your own categories within Wordpress. And lastly - don't even think about using formatted code from a pretty printer like <http://puzzleware.net/codehtmler/>. The output is disastrous!
