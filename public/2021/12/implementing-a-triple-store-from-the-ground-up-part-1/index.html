        <p>I&rsquo;ve long been fascinated with semantic web technologies, the potential of RDF
and understanding how to implement a triple store from the ground up.
Databases are one of those technologies - like compilers - that we often
take for granted, and yet which beneath the hood employs some very sophisticated
algorithms and data structures to achieve acceptable levels of performance.</p>
<p>In this new article series, I&rsquo;ll implement a triple store using techniques
introduced in recent years for efficiently storing and processing indexes on
large knowledge graphs.  I&rsquo;ll use C# 10 and .NET 6 as the platform, with the hope
that I can create something that works on most common platforms, as well as
supporting deployment via docker containers.  Expect a few digressions into
programming techniques in C#, where it&rsquo;s interesting, but otherwise I&rsquo;ll try to
stick to discussions about triple stores and high performance data stores.</p>
<p>Since this is a kind of intro post, I figure I&rsquo;d describe the lay of the land,
and what I hope to cover.  Since the implementation of databases is a very low
level task, I&rsquo;ll be working from the bottom up and moving to progressively more
usable code as I go.</p>
