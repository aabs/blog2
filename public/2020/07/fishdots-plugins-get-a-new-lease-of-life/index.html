      <p>Last week I mentioned that I was starting a rewrite of Fishdots. Well, a few of the plugins have now been ported over to the new instance of FD, which from now on I will call fd2.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>aabs/fish_checklists</strong></p>
<p>A fish plugin supporting production of event based checklists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>aabs/fish_git</strong></p>
<p>Simple fish plugin with some helpful git abbrs and functions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>aabs/fish_subcmd</strong></p>
<p>Fish shell plugin providing functions to set up multi-level commands (like git)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>aabs/fish_projects</strong></p>
<p>A simple project utility for those that work on many projects at the same time (from aabs/fishdots_projects)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>aabs/fish_notes</strong></p>
<p>fish plugin for managing text notes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>aabs/fish_tmux</strong></p>
<p>A simple fish plugin with tmux helpers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>aabs/fish_tech</strong></p>
<p>A plugin for fish shell to quickly jump to tech specific folders in a dev tree.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the plug-ins that I find most useful from day to day.  As I need them, I will convert over the other old fishdots plug-ins to the new framework.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you use any of these plug-ins, and whether you think they are useful or could stand to be improved.</p>
