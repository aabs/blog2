      <p>Well there is so much to write about, that I thought it was about time I jumped
onto the wagon, and told the world what&rsquo;s going on in my life, and in my head.
As the saying goes, the more that things change, the more they stay the same.
And that&rsquo;s certainly been true for me during the last few years. Change is the
only constrant in my life lately (except for Kerry - Oh, and Mosquitoes).</p>
<p>But more on that later. Anyway, welcome to my blog. Please syndicate it. I
recommend <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net/">http://www.sharpreader.net/</a> as the best I&rsquo;ve found so far.</p>
<p>Later I&rsquo;ll publish my OPML exports. You can see what news I&rsquo;m interested in.
Maybe you will be too, provided you have an unhealthy interest in .NET coding
gizmos and the latest fads in UK politics.</p>
