      Short Answer: Yes!
Regular readers of the The Wandering Glitch know I focused lots of attention on LINQ and the new wave of language innovation in C# 3.0. I&rsquo;m intrigued by functional programming in C#. At university, I focused on languages like C, C++, Eiffel and Ada. I&rsquo;ve never since needed to learn functional programming techniques - who uses them, after all? Functional programming had always seemed like a distant offshoot of some Bourbakiste school of mathematical programming unconcerned with practical issues of software development.

      I recently posted a question on Stack Overflow on the feasibility of using IL rewriting frameworks to rectify bad design after the fact. The confines of the answer comment area were too small to give the subject proper treatment so I though a new blog post was in order. Here&rsquo;s the original question:
 I&rsquo;ve recently been playing around with PostSharp, and it brought to mind a problem I faced a few years back: A client&rsquo;s developer had produced a web application, but they had not given a lot of thought to how they managed state information - storing it (don&rsquo;t ask me why) statically on the Application instance in IIS.

      I&rsquo;ve recently been using PostSharp 1.5 (Laos) to implement various features such as logging, tracing, API performance counter recording, and repeatability on the softphone app I&rsquo;ve been developing. Previously, we&rsquo;d been either using hand-rolled code generation systems to augment the APIs with IDisposable-style wrappers, or hand coded the wrappers within the implementation code. The problem was that by the time we&rsquo;d added all of the above, there were hundreds of lines of code to maintain around the few lines of code that actually provided a business benefit.

      Recently, Søren Skovsbøll wrote a excellent follow up to a little post I did a while back on using C# 3.0 expression trees for representing predicates in design by contract. The conclusion of that series was that C# was inadequate in lots of ways to the task of doing design by contract. Having said that, you can still achieve a lot using serialisation of object states and storage of predicates for running before and after a scope.

The project has been going for over a year and it&rsquo;s starting to be noticed by semantic web early adopters and semantic web product vendors***. LINQ provides a standardised query language and a platform enabling any developer to understand systems using semantic web technologies via LinqToRdf.

This version has been (partially) tested using a remote triple store based on Joseki and Jena, and seems to work fine. I intend over the coming months to put together some more comprehensive documentation on getting LinqToRdf up and running with a Jena triple store hosted in SQL server.

      Martin Fowler&rsquo;s bliki has a very good post on what he calls the &lsquo;technical debt quadrant&rsquo;. This post succinctly sums up the difference between those who produce poor designs in ways that are contrary to their best interests, and those who do so knowingly and reluctantly.
In the past I&rsquo;ve noted that many of those who profess to being agile are really just defaulters in the bank of technical debt. They confuse incurring inadvertent reckless technical debt with being Agile.

      Wow.
I have never seen anybody do such unnatural things with a guitar. I mean he was fiddling with it in ways that seemed bound to produce an awful cacophony, but somehow in his hands, the guitar produced a gorgeous sweet complex sound, that complemented the rest of the band perfectly. Wow.
I have to say, though, that if we were playing Star Qualities, he would definitely be &ldquo;50% Vin Diesel, 50% Gerard O&rsquo;Donnell&rdquo; For those of you in the know, that is a pretty weird combination.

This bud for a tree fern was about the size of my hand with fingers outstretched. It would be great to get a time laps of one of these unfolding. mind you, the humidity would have fritzed my camera way before it got through the sequence.
I love the fractal symmetry in the self similarity on each scale. I wonder how many levels of spiral there are in these buds?

      I&rsquo;ve recently been learning more about the OWL web ontology language in an attempt to find a way to represent SPARQL queries in LINQ. SPARQL and LINQ are very different, and the systems that they target are also dissimilar. Inevitably, it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine the techniques to employ in translating a query from one language to the other without actually trying to implpement the LINQ extensions. I&rsquo;ve got quite a long learning curve to climb.

There seems to be something essentially hard about distinguishing thoughts from the titanic amount of computations in the brain.

      [digg=http://www.digg.com/programming/Domain_Modeling_and_Ontology_Engineering] The semantic web is poised to influence us in ways that will be as radical as the early days of the Internet and World Wide Web. For software developers it will involve a paradigm shift, bringing new ways of thinking about the problems that we solve, and more-importantly bringing us new bags of tricks to play with.
One of the current favourite ways to add value to an existing system is through the application of data mining.

      Dom suggested that &ldquo;The distance to our goals always seems further to those realists without sufficient knowledge.&rdquo;. My personal experience in software indicates that when you are attempting to solve a difficult problem with many unknowns, you cannot predict the degree of complexity of the problem or solution without actually solving the problem. Good estimation in a software project is an exercise in pessimism. I also find that my pessimism is never enough!

      I spent most of my evening converting Jena to .NET. Needless to say it was only at the end of the evening that I discovered that Andy Seabourne (from my old home town of Bristol) had already worked out how to use IKVM to convert the jar files into assemblies. I&rsquo;m not bothered though; I produced make files (rather than shell scripts) that work better on cygwin. The best thing I got from Andy was his &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry be happy&rdquo; advice that IKVM spuriously complains about unfound classes - you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it.

      Last year, a company called DWave Systems announced their quantum computer (the &lsquo;Orion&rsquo;) - another milestone on the road to practical quantum computing. Their controversial claims seem worthy in their own right but they are particularly important to the semantic web (SW) community. The significance to the SW community was that their quantum computer solved problems akin to Grover&rsquo;s Algorithm speeding up queries of disorderly databases.
Semantic web databases are not (completely) disorderly and there are many ways to optimize the search for matching triples to a graph pattern.

      I recently ran across a problem with data bound controls in ASP.NET, where I set the string formatting specification (by the book) and nothing happened. If you come across this problem you are probably missing the HtmlEncode attribute on your column specification. Without this the braces are probably encoded and thus the formatting string is unrecognisable to the control. Consider adding the []{style=&ldquo;font-size:10px;font-family:Courier New;&quot;}[HtmlEncode]{style=&ldquo;color:red;&quot;}[=&ldquo;false&rdquo; ]{style=&ldquo;color:blue;&quot;}to your binding specifications - it worked for me.

      My last post explored the implementation of the Where extension method on IEnumerator and IQueryable. I showed that the filter method on enumerators visits every element in the collection. I also showed that calling Where on a Queryable just adds a new root to the expression tree. I ended with a promise to show how the queryable gets turned into a sequence of object references. This is the really innovative part of LINQ - If we want to provide a LINQ-style query language on some data store of our own, we need to understand how this stuff works.

Sad to say, but my holidays are over, and I’m back to work. I tried pretty hard to keep my hands away from the laptop while I was off, but I got itchy fingers towards the end so I had a stab at implementing a non-deterministic finite automaton (NDFA). I implemented it to give me an excuse to play with the C5 collections library.

Type Safety. The key reason is automatic type safety. Type safety ensures that when you make a call to another component you get the data you are after in the format you wanted.

      I recently came across the Dryad project at MS Research. It is concerned with the development of automated systems to deploy sequential systems across parallel platforms. This is an interesting and topical issue at the moment because the advent of multi-core processors poses problems for developers. In C#, at the very least, there is no inherent parallelization of the language. Developers have to explicitly code a system with threading or grid computing in mind.

      When I started implementing the SPARQL support in LINQ to RDF, I decided that I needed to implement as much of the standard query operators as possible. SPARQL is a very rich query language that bears a passing syntactical resemblance to SQL. It didn&rsquo;t seem unreasonable to expect most of the operators of LINQ to SQL to be usable with SPARQL. With this post I thought I&rsquo;d pass on a few design notes that I have gathered during the work to date on the SPARQL query provider.

      Last time I hurriedly showed you how you can perform the next step of converting a triple store into an ORM system of sorts. The purpose of all this activity, and the reason I left off blogging about LINQ was that I am working on a system to allow me to use LINQ with a triple store and reasoner. The benefit of doing so is that we should have a lot of the benefits of the modern relational world with the power and connectivity of the new world of the semantic web.

      Kingsley Idehen has again graciously given LinqToRdf some much needed link-love. He mentioned it in a post that was primarily concerned with the issues of mapping between the ontology, relational and object domains. His assertion is that LinqtoRdf, being an offshoot of an ORM related initiative, is reversing the natural order of mappings. He believes that in the world of ORM systems, the emphasis should be in mapping from the relational to the object domain.

Having explored a little of the code that backs up the functional programming aspects, I understand that although the extension run with the basic features of C# 2.0, there is a huge amount of C# code required to deliver the functional paradigm to C#.

      I&rsquo;ve been given a week by work to try to make some progress on the LINQ to RDF query provider, and I&rsquo;m glad to say that the query generation phase is now pretty much complete for SPARQL. It&rsquo;s amazing what a difference a full day can make to your progress, compared to trying to get as much done as I can when I&rsquo;m on the train.
Last week when I blogged, I had the rough outlines of a SPARQL query, but it was missing quite a bit.

      I was wondering the other day whether LINQ could be used with NMock easily. One problem with testing code that has not been written to work with unit tests is that if you test business logic, you often end up making multiple round-trips to the database for each test run. With a very large test suite that can turn a few minute&rsquo;s work into hours for a test suite. the best approach to this is to use mock data access components to dispense canned results, rather than going all the way through to the database.

OWL defines two types of property: DatatypeProperty and ObjectProperty. An object property links instances from two Classes, just like a reference in .NET between two objects. In OWL you define it like this:
&lt;owl:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&ldquo;isOnAlbum&rdquo;&gt; &lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&quot;#Track&quot;/&gt; &lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&quot;#Album&quot;/&gt; &lt;/owl:ObjectProperty&gt;
A DatatypeProperty is similar to a .NET property that stores some kind of primitive type like a string or an int. In OWL it looks like this:

      This time I&rsquo;m going to show you the design pattern that I use for code generation. Generally I use this for analysis of hierarchical structures, such as assemblies or database metadata. You could use it in other scenarios, where data is less structured. If you are familiar with the operation of a SAX parser and .NET events then you&rsquo;ll have no trouble understanding the design.
SAX-like Parser A SAX parser works by iterating through its material (in this case XML, but that&rsquo;s immaterial) firing off events for everything that it finds.

      As you will recall from the previous post, I have been wondering about how to implement the functionality for dynamic proxies. Well I saw this great article, by Viji Sarathy, on the web, and think that this might be the way to go.
It uses Context Bound Objects to ensure the interception of all calls by the CLR without any explicit framework setup by the user. We can guarantee that the contracts get followed, whether the user tries to evade them or not.

      This time I&rsquo;m going to explore some of the issues I&rsquo;ve found in converting the prototype over to work in a JIT environment. If you&rsquo;ve seen any of my previous posts, you&rsquo;ll know that I have a working prototype that uses static code generation to produce proxies to wrap objects that identify themselves with the DbcAttribute. These proxies are produced solely for those objects, so the developer has to know which items have predicates on them in order to instantiate the proxies rather than the target objects.

      I&rsquo;ve recently been working on a series of blog posts that require me to reverse engineer the contents of the LINQ assembly System.Query. My experience has largely been very positive, but I have one problem that has slowed my progress – navigating beyond polymorphic method calls. This isn&rsquo;t a problem with LINQ (it uses polymorphism in a number of key places) it&rsquo;s a problem with code reading generally.
I find that while abstraction frameworks are essential to allow clean factoring and decoupling of object models, they make interpretation of runtime behaviour very hard – the more fully encapsulated a framework is, the harder it is to read it&rsquo;s code and deduce how it works.

      Last time I described typed and un-typed events, and multicasting events to several listeners. One of those listeners would be a code generator. This time I&rsquo;ll go on to describe some of the necessary infrastructure that such a design requires. Generally this information is all about tieing the events together. The context in which an event takes place is as important as the event itself.
When you&rsquo;re generating code progressively, you need to keep track of what you have done, and what still needs to be done.

Every project has to address this issue in some way, most systems are developed on a platform that varies from its deployment environment. Most software must be tailored to behave differently on different platforms. Typically, a developer environment is different from a production environment, with some resources replaced by mock objects or stubs.

      What is the ideal of good design?
There are limitless answers to this question. Most of them focus on the day to day business of writing software – and aim to minimize the effects of bad design choices through application of a simple principle. The patchwork of these principles when applied in a harmonious way is hoped to give health and vigour to a system. When you write software, you generally hope to extend its lifespan beyond the short term - to help it become a living thing.

It&rsquo;s getting so tedious that I recently decided to answer the question to my own satisfaction. I produced a spreadsheet with as many design factors that I could think of and the different models that I have worked with or considered over the years.

      I recently got this excellent comment from Jeff Grigg on my domain model debate article. I started to reply with a comment, but the reply got to the point where it became a bit of a blog post in its own right, so I thought it worth giving it first class status. Jeff wrote this:
 Interesting concept: I particularly like the concept of using numeric weights and rankings, rather than just claims of preference.

      Andrew Cantos raised some interesting philosophical points in reply to my partially tongue in cheek post The Great Domain Model Debate - Solved the other day. As ever, my short reply turned into a blog post and this is it. Andrew&rsquo;s point was that there is a metaphorical link between objects in a domain model and elementary particles in some physical system. The ability of these elements to take part in the wider system is often a function of their sheer simplicity rather than being loaded with complex properties.

      The surge of religiosity in the US continues unabated. A survey from NEWSWEEK is the current cause of distress – apparently over 90% of Americans profess to be religious, and almost half reject the findings of science. Alarmingly, 35% of college graduates (the most educated of Americans) accept the bible as fact and believe that mankind sprung mysteriously into existence less than 10,000 years ago.
Less than one in ten Americans was willing to own-up to being an atheist – I suspect that as at other times when religiosity was in the ascendant, like the dark ages, there has been a danger of civic censure and communal intolerance of the atheist.

      This site is entertaining in the same way that nonsense poetry is. It is ingenious, and its obvious that a great deal of effort has been put into it, but it is not intended to make any sense. I am also bowled over by how powerful the memes are to be able to force these people into expending that much effort in the pursuit of the arguments. I&rsquo;ve seen the poor souls compelled out into the rain on a Saturday morning to spread the word, despite the fact that these (seemingly respectable) people are being rained on as well as showered with the contempt of their fellow men.

Lately, I have been bending poor Kerry&rsquo;s ear about this to the extent that I am now categorised as a grumpy old man.

      In a conversation I had with a colleague, it came to light that the British have another reason to be proud of their national heritage. As you may know, they were the nation that invented the queue. they take to the queue as ducks take to water, and queueticette is installed in their youth from the cradle. Not content with that, the British graduated in the 70s from simple linear queues to more complicated non-linear arrangements.

I spent years bemoaning the fact that the laws of physics didn&rsquo;t allow the wireless transmission of power. Now it seems that I bemoaned prematurely. Researchers at MIT have a found a way to use inductance to power a 60W (think similar power rating to a laptop) lightbulb from a distance of up to 2 metres.
I know it doesn&rsquo;t sound like much, but as I look at my desk I can&rsquo;t help thinking that a short range power transmitter would help.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Researchers at the University of Texas have developed a technique to create artificial muscle fibres using Carbon Nanotubes woven into a yarn a mere 2 microns thick. Each fibre has a strength equal to 100 times that of equivalent human muscle fibres. It is a expected that there will have revolutionary consequences for the prosthetic limb and robotics fields. I wonder whether the long-term outlook will be for elective muscular enhancement.

It&rsquo;s been a while since I last went therre, and it was good at the time, but since then it has grown and grown, and edged past some of the other similar projects.

I&rsquo;ve been taking the new Visual Studio Preview for a spin, and it&rsquo;s got some pretty nice new additions. These aren&rsquo;t just the headline features that have been publicized elsewhere, but the thoughtful additions to usability that will make our lives a little bit easier. They should also help us to make our code a lot cleaner and less complex. We see the introduction of easy performance reporting and differential comparison of profiling sessions.

He has taken the best of bash, awk, perl, VMS-DCL AS400 and WSH command line environments and has merged that language with a native .NET object pipeline model so that the command line directly pipes around .

      I have taken this stuff to the point where it is not too scruffy to release to the world. What I need to do now is publicise it to the world at large. Any ideas about the best forums for that? I think SourceForgeand gotdotnet will help, but I can also imagine that sharptools and USENET might be good avenues to publicise it through. How will I manage the project when I open the code up to the open source community?

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      The predicates that are used to specify the in, out and inv conditions on a component need to follow certain rules. The first and least obvious is that it must follow the syntax and semantic rules of the C# language. I say that it is the least obvious, since it seems to be conventional to invent a new predicate language for these purposes. I can see the point of this, since it would allow a tailor made language to be used, and to extend it beyond the capabilities of a normal C# expression.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Last time I started discussing the expression language used to define predicates on types and members. My conclusions were:
 C# expression syntax used since code must be transformed to that in the end, and the more similar the syntaxes of the expression language - the easier the transformation will be. No side-effects. Side effect within the predicates complicate the tasks of determining whether a temporal comparison is actually effective. If the snapshots can&rsquo;t be guaranteed to be faithful representations of the state before and after the test, then you can&rsquo;t trust the tests, and you might as well not have bothered with them in the first place.

      When I get the time I intend to start off this blog by exploring the following ideas:
 Developing a design by contract system for C# History of Design by Contract Code Generation Systems XSLT vs NVelocity  I&rsquo;m producing a Design by contract system that&rsquo;s in early alpha. It uses NVelocity, and declarative programming. It lets you write code like this:
[Dbc, Invariant(&quot;Prop1 &gt;= 1&quot;)] public class MyTestClass { public MyTestClass() { Prop1 = 10; } #region property Prop1 int prop1 = 0; [Requires(&quot;value !

      Last time I said I&rsquo;d explore the requirements on a DBC solution in a little more detail. I first experienced design by contract when I was studying object oriented design at Brighton University, UK. I was studying it under Richard Mitchell, author of &ldquo;Design by Contract, by Example&rdquo;. The curriculum was taught using Eiffel. Eiffel was (and is still is, as far as I know) the only programming language that has native support for design by contract.

      Now that I&rsquo;ve come up with a few requirements, and shown you how I am going to partition the problem, I think it might be about time to discuss some of our technological options.
I said previously that I had a serviceable NVelocity wrapper, that I could use for the code generation. I have other options too, though, and some of them might be better in the long run, than sticking with NVelocity.

      Perhaps the day has finally arrived when GNU/Linux seems like a viable option. Every six months or so I try out the latest GNU/Linux distros to see how they&rsquo;re progressing.

Normally I end up wandering off in disgust at the unfinished feel of the whole ensemble.

Child Linguistic Development is a document that I wrote when I was at university on the stages of language development. Since Emily and Thomas are now a week short of 18 months it is time for Kerry and I to start learning about learning. I&rsquo;d forgotten most of this stuff, so it will make interesting reading for me too!

Friday afternoon I got a call from Kerry saying that she&rsquo;d had a &lsquo;show&rsquo;. Naturally I wondered whether it was a cabaret or the normal sort.

A 100% crime detection and solving rate is clearly not compatible with most people&rsquo;s notions of civil liberty.

      Money is a medium of exchange that allows a society to be more efficient. If Society is viewed as an organism that seeks to minimise the wastage of effort, money is the perfect mechanism for achieving that aim. If we were to assume that an endeavour that gave greater profit was more useful to society than one that did not, simply because more utility was delivered per joule of energy expended, then investment by individuals, motivated only by greed, is the mechanism that is most liable to deliver the greatest utility to society as a whole.

      An aesthetic criterion for truth (believing in what appeals to your sense of harmony or beauty, or believing because of moral dogma) is a primitive, religious mentality that hampers progress. It was responsible for papal inquisitions. It was responsible for the &ldquo;final solution to the Jewish question&rdquo;, the stupidities of anti-creationism, belief in crop-circles, and countless other idiocies and cruelties down the ages.

      I subscribe to the idea that religion is a kind of dangerous but eradicable kind of cultural virus.
If people give in to the temptation of the aesthetic criterion for truth, then Science should not blame itself for the continued existence of Religion. People are not yet strong enough for the &ldquo;truth&rdquo;. The problem still remains - some of the worst doxological aesthetes are philosophers. If they are not going to do the persuading, then we shall have to rely on the pathos of religious life outweighing the desire for self delusion in the common man.

      This little script uses the JQuery getScript command, enforcing sequential loading order to ensure script dependencies are honoured:
function LoadScriptsSequentially(scriptUrls, callback) { if (typeof scriptUrls == 'undefined') throw &quot;Argument Error: URL array is unusable&quot;; if (scriptUrls.length == 0 &amp;&amp; typeof callback == 'function') callback(); $.getScript(scriptUrls.shift(), function() { LoadScriptsSequentially(scriptUrls, callback); }); }  Here&rsquo;s how you use it:
function InitialiseQueryFramework(runTests) { LoadScriptsSequentially([ &quot;/js/inheritance.js&quot;, &quot;/js/expressions.js&quot;, &quot;/js/refData.js&quot;, &quot;/js/queryRenderer.js&quot;, &quot;/js/sha1.js&quot;, &quot;/js/queryCache.js&quot;, &quot;/js/unit-tests.js&quot;], function() { queryFramework = new QueryManager(&quot;#query&quot;); if (runTests) RunTestSuite(); }); }  I love java script now and can&rsquo;t understand why I avoided it for years.

I am fully convinced that such breakthroughs can be used to tackle the issues of world poverty, but I&rsquo;ve just finished reading Tomorrow&rsquo;s War by David Shukman. It was written over 10 years ago but was gloomy, even then about our chances of controlling the proliferation of expertise in the production of WMD, and it was written before 9/11.

      The semantic web is a GOOD THING by definition - anything that enables us to create smarter software without also having to create Byzantine application software must be a step in the right direction. The problem is - many people have trouble translating the generic term &ldquo;smarter&rdquo; into a concrete idea of what they would have to do to achieve that palladian dream. I think a few concrete ideas might help to firm up people&rsquo;s understanding of how the semantic web can help to deliver smarter products.

      Yes, like all the other gullible fools, with highly reactive immune systems, I have invested my hard-earned money in a mosquito-click (tm). On the tin it says that as few as five clicks will inhibit the histamine reaction and 10 clicks will also neutralise the foriegn matter injected by the insect, by denaturing any proteins in them through electric pressure.
Well, I should have guessed that if I suffered enough from the bites to pay $20, then I was gonna need a lot more than 5 clicks to eradicate the histamine.

      As many of you may be aware, in light of the current nightly disturbances occurring all over France, the French government has just announced a raise in its terror alert level from &ldquo;Run&rdquo; to &ldquo;Hide&rdquo;. The normal level is &ldquo;General Arrogance&rdquo;, and the only two higher levels in France are &ldquo;Surrender&rdquo; and &ldquo;Collaborate&rdquo;. The rise was precipitated by a recent arsonist fire that destroyed France&rsquo;s white flag factory in an ethnic suburb of Paris, effectively paralyzing the country&rsquo;s military capability.

      Some time back I wrote a quote of the day: There is no greater joy than soaring high on the wings of your dreams, except maybe the joy of watching a dreamer who has nowhere to land but in the ocean of reality. For a moment I though the quote was apropos for Alec Clew&rsquo;s announcement of his apostasy, but after a moment&rsquo;s reflection I realize that it&rsquo;s not.
Alec wrote the other day that, due to driver problems, he was thinking that he may have to depart the sunlit pastures of Gnu/Linux to return to the dreary halls of Windows XP.

      I&rsquo;ve always been a believer in the power of good advertising, which is why I was so pleased to see this fantastic example of the art in Melbourne this week.  It has it all - it has the doleful situation of the foolish dolt who has so willfully left himself in a state of baldness that is, as we can see by the &ldquo;after&rdquo; photo, so obviously reversible. I salute this masterpiece of modern advertising, and hope that television advertisers can learn from it.

      This is the first in a short series introducing Knowledge Graphs. It covers just the basics, showing how to write, store, query and work with graph data using RDF (short for Resource Description Format). I will keep it free of theory and interesting but unnecessary digressions. Let me know in the comments if you find it useful, and also tell me what other Knowledge Graph topics you would like to know more about.

      Last time I showed how to write RDF in Turtle, and how to make very simple queries in SPARQL. What I didn&rsquo;t show was how to get your hands dirty. Specifically, I want to show you how to try things out on the cheap command line. I will show examples of how to build out your RDF data to more depth using Turtle files, and how to use the Jena framework to create queries against that data, so you can work out ahead of time how to navigate your graph of data.

      In my notation a simple grammatical structure is represented as a triple of the form [subject | action | object] with elements of the triple annotated with gliphs to represent tense, belief etc.
One of the elements that has never satisfied me is constructions that are kind of three way sentences such as &ldquo;john threw the ball to tom&rdquo; which in the notation is represented as [john | throw_p | &lt;to, tom, ball&gt;] It could of course be written as two statements

      Derek&rsquo;s kittens are displaying behaviour that seems to be hard wired. There is a huge range of examples of linguistic capabilities seeming to follow a strict developmental schedule &ndash; use of verbs, tenses or telegraphic speach all arrive at about the same age in children. Chomsky is the most famous linguist to claim that language, or core parts of it, are inate. His justification was that there appears to be a poverty of input in a child&rsquo;s linguistic environment.

      The process of creating a LINQ query provider is reasonably straightforward. Had it been documented earlier, there would have doubtless been dozens of providers written by now. Here&rsquo;s the broad outline of what you have to do.
 Find the best API to talk to your target data store. Create a factory or context object to build your queries. Create a class for the query object(s). Choose between IQueryable&lt;T&gt; and IOrderedQueryable&lt;T&gt;.

That got me to thinking, if you can entrain your brainwaves deliberately to give you more vitality and concentration, isn&rsquo;t it possible to accidentally find yourself in an environment that has the opposite effect on you?

This is little oberon bay on Wilson&rsquo;s Prom. Taki and I went there at the start of the year. It is sooo gorgeous to look at in this photo, and despite the fact that the temperature was up above 30C the water was bitterly cold and we couldn&rsquo;t cope for long.
I think it may have had something to do with the fact that there was only open water between us and Antarctica.

Aside from the fact that C# isn&rsquo;t even in there, which I find a little alarming, it shows that all of the languages listed are in decline. Especially my beloved C++, king of all languages.

      I&rsquo;ve posted a whole bunch (well 45) bugs on the GotDotNet bug tracker for enhancements that nORM should not have to live too long without. Some of them ought to be fairly easy to deliver, like changing method names to have a clean and consistent format. Others are a bit more of a challenge - like adding persistence support for XML documents and reverse engineering an entity model from a schema file.

      The initial design that I used when I made the ancestor of norm was based upon designs by Scott Ambler - The initial intent of Ambler&rsquo;s designs was definitely to provide an abstraction around the logic of a relational database. What I want to do with norm is to abstract the very notion of a data structure. When we persist an object into a row on a RDB it is almost irrelevant that the data is persistent.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      About 6 years ago I read a book by Edward de Bono, called modestly the de Bono Code Book. His idea was to devise a representation for thoughts and statements that went beyond the simple propositions from predicate logic. Initially, I was intrigued by the idea that I could learn to represent ideas in a way that was both terse, unambiguous and that enhanced my abilities to reason on paper. I quickly became disillusioned by the notation because it was both arbitrary and incomprehensible; there was no obvious way (as far as I could make out) for representing an arbitrary thought.

He had 15cm teeth, and was around 13 meters from the tip of his ferocious maw to the end of his whip-like tail. He could swallow grown men whole with ease, and could probably catch them even if they were in a jeep.

What I needed to do was kick off a few activities that run periodically in their own thread. As ever, I started out by writing code to manage signaling to between the main thread and the worker thread with sleep periods when there was nothing to do, till it was time to start again.

I just read a very interesting post by Tony Wright, on the relative cost of fixing a bug in different stages of a project. Do we need a better justification for applying a little bit of forethought to a problem before rushing headlong into the implementation phase of a project?

      It seems I touched a bit of a raw nerve with Alec when I pointed out that some IDEs are less crap than others. Specifically, I was referring to the ones that have major corporate clout invested in their production. He pointed out that they require standardisation of tools within a development team as well as standardisation of APIs, SCM tools, documentation, and build tools. He also points out that they obscure information from the developer that is necessary for the proper understanding of a complex system.

      Darren Neimke posted some interesting thoughts today about the way developers lose their drive on a project, and how it&rsquo;s reflected in SCRUM meetings. He thought that it might be due to the SCRUM meetings themselves. Daniel Crowley-Wilson has another idea - the developers are just bored.
Developers relish challenges and opportunities to do new things, and solve novel problems. As Daniel says, about midway through a project, there is little novelty in the problems left to be solved.

Despite having used a laptop at work for years, I&rsquo;ve always kept a paper notebook by my side. I depend on these notebooks. I even purchased the whole UK supply of Paperchase&rsquo;s 500 page, leatherette, squared, rounded notebooks. These beauties are un-dog-ear-able, perfect for UML diagrams, lightweights and relatively inexpensive. The supply in the UK was dwindling when I discovered them in Cambridge. Apparently the Japanese manufactured them, and the Americans were buying whatever stocks were left.

      I did a quick search on the new Google trends service, for the word &lsquo;algorithm&rsquo;.
The top 6 cities out of the top 10, were in india.
Perhaps I should move to India. they get to use algorithms there!
Either way, it seems that that would be a fair indicator of the fact that western developers are writing less low level code than the indians? Either that or the india programmers need to refer to the web for help more often.

      Eurekalert has an interesting headline today about robots developed at Vermont University that can self heal or adapt if they find something wrong with themselves. The news report highlighted the fact that this could herald a new generation of autonomous robots that can learn to adapt to the harsh environments that they would experience on Mars for example. I was more impressed by the solution that the researchers had developed. The robot maintains a &lsquo;self image&rsquo; which it monitors.

      Semantic Overflow has been active for a couple of weeks. We now have 155 users and 53 questions. We&rsquo;ve already had some very interesting questions and some excellent detailed and thoughtful responses. I thought, on Egon&rsquo;s instigation, to bring together, from the site&rsquo;s BI stats, some of the highlights of last week.
The best loved question this week came from Jerven Bolleman who wanted to know whether there was a &ldquo;Simple CLI useable OWL Reasoner&rdquo;.

      In a previous post, I kinda outed myself as a lover of &ldquo;find | xargs&rdquo; and grep. It seems that I inadvertantly gave offence to Jeffrey Snover (the architect of powershell), for whom I have great respect. So I thought I ought to set the record straight.
I like powershell a lot, and I suspect that it was familiarity with Unix that drove me back to Cygwin. I was truly inspired by the Channel9 interview that Jeffrey Snover gave.

Well, the short answer is an unqualified &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.
The long answer (based on our own experiences) is that simplistic mainstream trolls or opinion pieces will attract more passing traffic than a carefully thought out, meticulously planned, thrice-proof-read epistles.

      Security vendor VeriSign found 66 percent would choose to give up their passwords for a Starbucks coffee, during an informal on-the-street survey conducted Thursday in San Francisco.
I&rsquo;m speechless!!! Not about the fact that people would give up their passwords for a cup of coffee. But that they thought that starbucks coffee was worth the price of a password. I mean, have you tasted that slop? It&rsquo;s the weakest, palest most bland coffee in the world (generally about as interesting as VeriSign&rsquo;s line of business).

      I thought that since I have installed SharpReader (the best RSS news reader on the net) for Kerry on Carbon, I might upload a few of the feeds that I read daily for her (and you) to check out.
Take a look at this file. You may have to convert the file to have the extension &ldquo;.opml&rdquo; to be able to import it into sharpreader, but it should work eventually. Its quite cool what is being done with RSS lately, my meager feed collection includes feeds for the weather, for VSS checkins at work, for new jobs posted in Melbourne, blogs, gmail, photos from friends and of course news syndication - it even has newsfeeds of new newsfeeds.

      There are many press releases on the web discussing the wonderful (or terrible, depending on your point of view) development of academic lectures being distributed to the world at large as podcasts. I fall firmly in the camp of those who think such a development is a mark of progress and a step towards realising the dream of free access to high quality ideas and well-thought-out commentary that will support the growth of civilisation in this increasingly dark age that we inhabit.

      But I was just testing whether Word 2007 is actually able to initiate the upload of a new blog post. It seems to me that it might be able to refresh an existing blog entry on wordpress, but beyond that it reports false positives. Of course, if you read this post, then you can disregard all of the above as blatant slander.
Update: yes, word posts OK to Wordpress, but it uses the default value for DateTime jan 1st 1970.

I finally grew irritated with not being able to categorise my blog entries. So I&rsquo;ve moved over to Wordpress, which in some ways is not as good as Blogger (esp the WYSIWYG editing) but blogger broke down the other day, and precipitated this fickle blogger to jump ship. Doubtless I&rsquo;ll be back, but in the meantime I&rsquo;ll be found at http://aabs.wordpress.com/ and if you are Web2.

      Today I got my first experience of being caught in a storm of golf ball sized hailstones. We&rsquo;d decided to take the day out and visit the Moomba Festival in the city centre. All was well, and the kids were in a cub scouts arena trying their hands at rock climbing. Suddenly, we heard an ominous rumbling and within seconds we were pelted with inch thick hailstones.
We quickly caught the kids as they fell off the climbing wall, and nobly covered them with our bodies as we hurried them into the canvas awnings that the scoutleaders had erected earlier in the day.
