      Do you suppose silicon based life forms construct computers from carbon and then agonize over whether they will become intelligent?
A 100% crime detection and solving rate is clearly not compatible with most people&rsquo;s notions of civil liberty. This implies that there are certain types and levels of crime that we are tacitly prepared to tolerate. What are they and how much. If you are still in doubt, how would you react to being compelled to provide a DNA fingerprint for a national database?

      Just when we thought we were on the way to a new age of enlightenment and reason, along comes the X-files and makes gullibility fashionable again.
The truth is always available. Choosing not to believe the truth when the truth is obvious or verifiable is intellectual suicide. Just because Mulder and Scully are snappy dressers, good-looking seekers after the improbable truth that is &ldquo;out there,&rdquo; we must all follow suite. We must do it while having our colons irrigated in our own personal, natural, organic floatation tanks.

      There are real boundaries to thought, that are genetically endowed in people. People who formulate new ideas may be either finding something that was always possible to think in all of us, or they may be mutants! They may even be aliens trying to subvert our culture. We should therefore subject all innovators in all areas to an inquisition to make sure that they are one of us.

      Money is a medium of exchange that allows a society to be more efficient. If Society is viewed as an organism that seeks to minimise the wastage of effort, money is the perfect mechanism for achieving that aim. If we were to assume that an endeavour that gave greater profit was more useful to society than one that did not, simply because more utility was delivered per joule of energy expended, then investment by individuals, motivated only by greed, is the mechanism that is most liable to deliver the greatest utility to society as a whole.

      There is a basic contradiction in both free market economics and command economics, which can only be reconciled by legislation that is informed by the principles of cybernetics and chaos theory etc. By legislation that seeks to provide free flow of information and cash, while at the same time reducing certain freedoms to exploit workers and hoard information or cash.
