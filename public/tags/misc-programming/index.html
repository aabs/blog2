      Well, EDS seemed grim-in-the-extreme, they want someone to spend two months writing some godawful burocratic change request document for some Telstra billing department. I think that my facial expression may have hinted at the miasmic feeling of despondency and depression I felt at the prospect of having to wade neck-deep through so much pointless paper. I doubt I&rsquo;ll hear back from them, especially after asking to see one of their documents to check the level of design they wanted from me - only to discover that there was none!

      Already T**stra is beginning to fade into an unhappy recollection. Considering that I congratulated myself on my good judgment in getting myself a place in an Australian household name on my CV, I&rsquo;m feeling a little (a lot) foolish now. I have worked for places with as pathological environment as Telstra before, but very seldom, and my job-hunting process has sensitized me now to the cultures of the corporations I&rsquo;m approaching.

      The graph below I found from a recruitment site. It lists the relative importance of programming language skills and how they have changed over the last few years.
Aside from the fact that C# isn&rsquo;t even in there, which I find a little alarming, it shows that all of the languages listed are in decline. Especially my beloved C++, king of all languages. Does this graph indicate that there is a proliferation of languages and that the impact of previously major languages is being diluted.

      &hellip; why people are so keen to be famous:
Because when you&rsquo;re famous you can burn your bridges.
I happen to want to burn mine so much right now, that I could spit! What was I thinking? Tomorrow would have been my last day. It still could be, but I can&rsquo;t just walk out, cos that would mean I might get a bad reference, which I can&rsquo;t afford.
Grrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!

      I have an interview with EDS, a large consultancy company for a Telstra-inspired short term project. I was beginning to wonder whether all I was ever going to get was phone calls from strangers wanting to be my best mate, or prove to me that they are wankers. Why do they always want to meet me&hellip;I can&rsquo;t make out whether they are play-acting business, or whether they believe that knowing what I look like might make my resume more believable than it is.
