      I have been tweeking and fiddling with the framework in readiness for making it open source. There are still quite a few things I ought to do before making any attempt to publicise it. I thought that since I&rsquo;ve been very remiss in not posting to this blog lately I could do some posting. How better than to list what I&rsquo;ve got to do before the system is unveiled to the public?

      I have set up the sourceforge project. You can find it here. I&rsquo;ve also classified all of the work, and split it up into releases.
Here&rsquo;s what will go into release one:
 Configuration Use native .NET configuration Configuration Remove existing config assembly Installers WIX installers Runtime Control Add transactional support from COM+ Runtime Control Extend reverse engineering to examine SPs and create wrappers for them. Runtime Control Configurable ID strategy Runtime Control Configurable transaction isolation policy Templates Move core templates into resource assembly Testing Create a proper test database Runtime Control Divide system between runtime and development projects Runtime Control Standardise all names to CamelCase

      I am finally getting around to making use of Aabs.Dbc in my new open source porject Aabs.Norm. I figured that the best proving ground for a thing like this is a thing like that. That is, a highly complex, high performance application framework, that maintains a state in a variety of very complex ways, that uses polymorphism and .NET in sophisticated ways, and that will be adversely affected if the performance of Aabs.

      I&rsquo;m blogging my progress from mid-way through the project. I have a working prototype, which is a crude implementation of what I want. It has a few limitations which require me to go back and productise it. It may seem a little arbitrary for me to describe a domain split on my second blog post, before even telling you what the requirements are. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s just that that was what I was thinking about, when I started this blog.

      I have taken this stuff to the point where it is not too scruffy to release to the world. What I need to do now is publicise it to the world at large. Any ideas about the best forums for that? I think SourceForgeand gotdotnet will help, but I can also imagine that sharptools and USENET might be good avenues to publicise it through. How will I manage the project when I open the code up to the open source community?

I&rsquo;ve created an open-source project on sourceforge, and advertised there for help with documentation, installers and general app developers. I&rsquo;ve uploaded an initial source code release - and configured my paypal settings.
I can&rsquo;t wait to see how it is received by the public. Pay the site a visit, and let me know what YOU think. And, of course, if you want to make a donation&hellip; ;o)

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      The predicates that are used to specify the in, out and inv conditions on a component need to follow certain rules. The first and least obvious is that it must follow the syntax and semantic rules of the C# language. I say that it is the least obvious, since it seems to be conventional to invent a new predicate language for these purposes. I can see the point of this, since it would allow a tailor made language to be used, and to extend it beyond the capabilities of a normal C# expression.

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Last time I started discussing the expression language used to define predicates on types and members. My conclusions were:
 C# expression syntax used since code must be transformed to that in the end, and the more similar the syntaxes of the expression language - the easier the transformation will be. No side-effects. Side effect within the predicates complicate the tasks of determining whether a temporal comparison is actually effective. If the snapshots can&rsquo;t be guaranteed to be faithful representations of the state before and after the test, then you can&rsquo;t trust the tests, and you might as well not have bothered with them in the first place.

      When I get the time I intend to start off this blog by exploring the following ideas:
 Developing a design by contract system for C# History of Design by Contract Code Generation Systems XSLT vs NVelocity  I&rsquo;m producing a Design by contract system that&rsquo;s in early alpha. It uses NVelocity, and declarative programming. It lets you write code like this:
[Dbc, Invariant(&quot;Prop1 &gt;= 1&quot;)] public class MyTestClass { public MyTestClass() { Prop1 = 10; } #region property Prop1 int prop1 = 0; [Requires(&quot;value !

      Last time I said I&rsquo;d explore the requirements on a DBC solution in a little more detail. I first experienced design by contract when I was studying object oriented design at Brighton University, UK. I was studying it under Richard Mitchell, author of &ldquo;Design by Contract, by Example&rdquo;. The curriculum was taught using Eiffel. Eiffel was (and is still is, as far as I know) the only programming language that has native support for design by contract.

      Now that I&rsquo;ve come up with a few requirements, and shown you how I am going to partition the problem, I think it might be about time to discuss some of our technological options.
I said previously that I had a serviceable NVelocity wrapper, that I could use for the code generation. I have other options too, though, and some of them might be better in the long run, than sticking with NVelocity.
