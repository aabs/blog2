      &ldquo;I find the whole orientation of the heavens to be contrary to all that I&rsquo;ve known as true&rdquo;.
So said Andrew Matthews, at a recent conference of the cognescenti. He went on to add that the orientation and movement of the heavens in the antipodes is exactly the opposite of what is found in the northern hemisphere, and that he is the first to recognise this fact and to talk about it.

      Yes, like all the other gullible fools, with highly reactive immune systems, I have invested my hard-earned money in a mosquito-click (tm). On the tin it says that as few as five clicks will inhibit the histamine reaction and 10 clicks will also neutralise the foriegn matter injected by the insect, by denaturing any proteins in them through electric pressure.
Well, I should have guessed that if I suffered enough from the bites to pay $20, then I was gonna need a lot more than 5 clicks to eradicate the histamine.

The sad part was it was Andrew Patocs, not Andrew Matthews, who wears the laurel wreath this evening. Andrew Matthews has spent the day in a darkened room wondering why he didn&rsquo;t admit defeat earlier.

      As many of you may be aware, in light of the current nightly disturbances occurring all over France, the French government has just announced a raise in its terror alert level from &ldquo;Run&rdquo; to &ldquo;Hide&rdquo;. The normal level is &ldquo;General Arrogance&rdquo;, and the only two higher levels in France are &ldquo;Surrender&rdquo; and &ldquo;Collaborate&rdquo;. The rise was precipitated by a recent arsonist fire that destroyed France&rsquo;s white flag factory in an ethnic suburb of Paris, effectively paralyzing the country&rsquo;s military capability.

 Donald Rumsfeld is giving the President his daily briefing. He concludes by saying: &ldquo;Yesterday, 3 Brazilian soldiers were killed.&rdquo; &ldquo;OH NO!&rdquo; the President exclaims. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo; As the President sits, head in hands, his staff quietly watch this display of emotion.

At about 5,000 feet, still struggling, he noticed someone coming up from the ground at about the same speed as he was going towards the ground. As they passed each other at 3,000 feet, the &lsquo;chutist yells, &ldquo;HEY! DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PARACHUTES?&rdquo; The reply came, fading towards the end, &ldquo;NO!
