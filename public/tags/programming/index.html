      It&rsquo;s been a while since I last blogged. I moved to Readify, and have been burning the midnight oil ever since! But I wrote some code the other day that I thought might come in handy in future, so I thought I&rsquo;d blog it.
What I needed to do was kick off a few activities that run periodically in their own thread. As ever, I started out by writing code to manage signaling to between the main thread and the worker thread with sleep periods when there was nothing to do, till it was time to start again.

      Alec, a man of great perspicacity, and wisdom, has granted us another Agile pearl of wisdom. All of which is totally correct. There&rsquo;s no doubt that if you are with The Complicators, then you can screw up a product no matter what method you follow.
Let&rsquo;s just try a thought experiment though – Imagine you&rsquo;d been disciplined and hadn&rsquo;t thought of the future at all, and you&rsquo;d designed your system solely to work on RJE 2780.

      As you may have already gathered, I have some reservations about the value of Agile and XP methodologies. I&rsquo;ve even gone so far as to say that they are a license to cut corners.
I just read a very interesting post by Tony Wright, on the relative cost of fixing a bug in different stages of a project. Do we need a better justification for applying a little bit of forethought to a problem before rushing headlong into the implementation phase of a project?

      It seems I touched a bit of a raw nerve with Alec when I pointed out that some IDEs are less crap than others. Specifically, I was referring to the ones that have major corporate clout invested in their production. He pointed out that they require standardisation of tools within a development team as well as standardisation of APIs, SCM tools, documentation, and build tools. He also points out that they obscure information from the developer that is necessary for the proper understanding of a complex system.

      Alec recently replied to one of my Agile diatribes with a very interesting set of comments. His point is that no project will succeed if it is badly run. I&rsquo;d be the first to admit that in some cases, I should probably have stood my ground or found a more stable compromise. But we have to admit that many project managers are likely to be less savvy or less principled than Alec.

If you experience any of those problems, please check that you have done the following:

      It seems that our little Anti-Agile spat generated a fair amount of traffic for both Alec and I. Alec&rsquo;s excellent blog attracted a record number of visitors. Quite right too. Evidently Mitch&rsquo;s comment about opinion being more of a draw than painstakingly researched and presented essays was right. [Controversy drives up the ratings. ]{style=&ldquo;text-decoration:underline;&quot;}I say &ldquo;hey ho!&rdquo; let&rsquo;s go with the most direct way to get things going – Alec baiting.
