      This site is entertaining in the same way that nonsense poetry is. It is ingenious, and its obvious that a great deal of effort has been put into it, but it is not intended to make any sense. I am also bowled over by how powerful the memes are to be able to force these people into expending that much effort in the pursuit of the arguments. I&rsquo;ve seen the poor souls compelled out into the rain on a Saturday morning to spread the word, despite the fact that these (seemingly respectable) people are being rained on as well as showered with the contempt of their fellow men.

      Click this link to see the single largest threat to democracy the world is currently facing. This bunch of evil techno-terrorists is ravening at the gates of western civilization. You have every right to fear these people. Their military might fought America to a standstill. How can we withstand such an enemy? These crack commandos are hiding in plain sight disguised as CAMELS!
Or, to put it another way :-

      Eric Gunnerson, has a very true post about how many of those who manage or participate in software development have caught the &lsquo;lets post-modernise our language to pretend we&rsquo;re innovating, rather then give an extra effort to clarify our thinking&rsquo; bug. Lately, I have been bending poor Kerry&rsquo;s ear about this to the extent that I am now categorised as a grumpy old man. Not that I care what the world thinks, but I think that language has more value if it is clear.

      According to this BBC report, the UK economy is losing billions to those Nigerian scams. Even though I don&rsquo;t need to explain which scams to those of you who read this - they are proverbial - there are unspeakably avaricious and gullible cretins out there who still send their money into the Nigerian black economy.
I suppose if these people are moronic enough to think that the son/daughter of the Nigerian Mister for transport/embezzlement/finance would single them out from the billions of other candidates to share their booty with, then they deserve what they get.
