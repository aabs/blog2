      <description>With this installment we finally get to the part of knowledge graphs that I personally find really exciting: Semantics. In this installment, I will introduce some of the simple rules of entailment that are a part of the RDFS standard.
This is part 6 of an ongoing series providing a little background on ‘knowledge graphs‘. The aim is to let software developers get up to speed as fast as possible. No theory, no digressions, and no history.</description>
