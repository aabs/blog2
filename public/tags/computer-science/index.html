      [digg=http://digg.com/general_sciences/2000_Year_Old_Computer_Recreated]Archaeologists from the University of Cardiff have finally worked out how to put together a complex mechanism that was found in the 2000 year old ruins of a sunken boat off the coast of Greece. The announcement was impressive because this mechanical calculating device had defied researcher&rsquo;s attempts to understand it for over a hundred years. The device was used to calculate the position of both the moon and the sun during their orbit, and to calculate eclipses with remarkable accuracy.

      Lately I&rsquo;ve been exploring old prototype code I wrote year ago. It always amazes me to se how my coding style changes over the years. It also intrigues me, because it&rsquo;s a kind of cross between archeology and journaling. I can see what I was doing years ago. I wrote this little C++ memory simulation back in 2002, for a the memory component of a little CPU simulator:
struct memory { byte_t* mem; unsigned int size;``memory(unsigned int x = vpc::mem_size) { mem = new byte_t[x]; size = x; //memset(mem, 0, size); } ~memory() { if(mem !

      Grady Booch seems to be back into his stride after his recent illness. In his most recent blog post (Thursday, October 12, 2006) he criticises the unscrupulous advocacy of SOA as though it were a silver bullet. He also points out that any successes of SOA were more than likely due to the application of Architecture, rather than Service Orientation. He points out that SOA is a platform specific kind of message passing architecture that capitalises on the benefits of web technologies to simplify message passing on the internet.

      What is the ideal of good design?
There are limitless answers to this question. Most of them focus on the day to day business of writing software – and aim to minimize the effects of bad design choices through application of a simple principle. The patchwork of these principles when applied in a harmonious way is hoped to give health and vigour to a system. When you write software, you generally hope to extend its lifespan beyond the short term - to help it become a living thing.

 Eradicate typographical errors from the development process. Remove source code from the development process. Move the emphasis of the development process from coding to design. Make the development process a visual rather than linguistic one. Move maintenance from code to design. Make debugging easy Make designs directly executable Make viewing levels of abstraction easy. Make moving from one level of abstraction to aqnother easy.

      The future of search lies in finding ways to bypass search engines altogether. Where information exists locally to make sense of what you’re after it’ll be used to create better searches. Data mining will be used to form a picture of what results go together, and what meanings a user attaches to a word. Alternative, unambiguous entry points to the web, like spatial search, will provide alternative, quicker routes to data for compatible hand-held devices.

      The executive summary is that we will have computing capacity to handle whole brain simulations by around 2020, and that Moores law applies to functional brain mapping as well as to processors.
 &ldquo;I figure we need about 10 quadrillion calculations a second to provide a functional equivalent to all the regions of the brain. IBM&rsquo;s Blue Gene/L computer is already at 100 trillion. If we plug in the semiconductor industry&rsquo;s projections, we can see that 10 quadrillion calculations a second will be available for $1,000 by around 2020.
