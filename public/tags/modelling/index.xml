      <description>Knowledge Graphs provide a neat and easy way to segment your data, called &amp;lsquo;Named Graphs&amp;rsquo;. This post shows how you access them, and different uses they may be put to.
This is part 7 of an ongoing series providing a little background on Knowledge Graphs. The aim is to let software developers get up to speed as fast as possible. No theory, no digressions, and no history. Just practical knowledge.</description>

      <description>This installment moves beyond the simple graph model of RDF to introduce the modelling support of RDF Schema. I will go on to show you how using the W3C Standard RDFS imbues your data with another layer of meaning, and makes it easier for you to enrich your raw data with meaning over time.
