      Alfred Thompson recently blogged about an interesting interview given by Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of C++, now professor of computer science at Texas A&amp;M University. As ever the interviewers were after his prescription for the Silver Bullet that will save us all from ourselves. Alfred has already boiled down the interview to a couple of interesting sound bites, and I aim to do the same to his post. The quote that particularly caught my attention was Stroustrup&rsquo;s comment on the &lsquo;pragmatic&rsquo; way in which modern software gets developed.

      Darren Neimke posted some interesting thoughts today about the way developers lose their drive on a project, and how it&rsquo;s reflected in SCRUM meetings. He thought that it might be due to the SCRUM meetings themselves. Daniel Crowley-Wilson has another idea - the developers are just bored.
Developers relish challenges and opportunities to do new things, and solve novel problems. As Daniel says, about midway through a project, there is little novelty in the problems left to be solved.

Despite having used a laptop at work for years, I&rsquo;ve always kept a paper notebook by my side. I depend on these notebooks. I even purchased the whole UK supply of Paperchase&rsquo;s 500 page, leatherette, squared, rounded notebooks. These beauties are un-dog-ear-able, perfect for UML diagrams, lightweights and relatively inexpensive. The supply in the UK was dwindling when I discovered them in Cambridge. Apparently the Japanese manufactured them, and the Americans were buying whatever stocks were left.

      I did a quick search on the new Google trends service, for the word &lsquo;algorithm&rsquo;.
The top 6 cities out of the top 10, were in india.
Perhaps I should move to India. they get to use algorithms there!
Either way, it seems that that would be a fair indicator of the fact that western developers are writing less low level code than the indians? Either that or the india programmers need to refer to the web for help more often.
