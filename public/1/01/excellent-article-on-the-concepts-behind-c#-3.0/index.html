      <p>Thomas Petricek has written a very interesting article on the new concepts behind C# 3.0 (<a href="http://www.tomasp.net/articles/csharp3-concepts.aspx">here</a>). It shows the origin of many of the functional programming features found in C# 3.0 from <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/Comega/">Cω</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/">F#</a>. Having explored a little of the code that backs up the functional programming aspects, I understand that although the extension run with the basic features of C# 2.0, there is a huge amount of C# code required to deliver the functional paradigm to C#. Most of that code provides complex code generation, type inference and declarative programming support.</p>
<p>In the first section on first class function support – I found on closer inspection (within LINQ at least) that these first class functions, are actually delivered through calls to the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/system.reflection.emit.dynamicmethod.aspx">DynamicMethod</a> method of System.Reflection.Emit. If you disassemble its code, you&rsquo;ll see that the relationship between the imperative and functional programming in C# is through &lsquo;<em>runtime support</em>&rsquo;. The functional programming extensions are a runtime extension to the CLR that generates code to fulfill declarative requirements. That is – there&rsquo;s no new radical paradigm at work in the core code, but the way it&rsquo;s exposed will simplify things so much that it might as well be called a new paradigm.</p>
<p>Well worth a read.</p>
