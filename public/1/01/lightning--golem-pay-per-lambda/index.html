That would be a VERY different kind of deployment and orchestration model. Perhaps you might submit a Kubernetes/Docker Swarm YAML file and a secure data source, and dynamically direct hosting to the lowest bidder.
What would security have to look like for this idea to work?">

<p>***    Golem Is The New Way The Internet Will Work* **</p>
<p>Golem is a global, open sourced, decentralized supercomputer that anyone can access. It&rsquo;s made up of the combined power of user&rsquo;s machines, from personal laptops to entire datacenters.</p>
<p>Anyone will be able to use Golem to compute (almost) any program you can think of, from rendering to research to running websites, in a completely decentralized &amp; inexpensive way.</p>
<p>The Golem Network is a decentralized sharing economy of computing power, where anyone can make money &lsquo;renting&rsquo; out their computing power or developing &amp; selling software.</p>
<p><a href="https://lightning.network/">Lightning Network</a></p>
<p>***    Transactions for the Future***</p>
<p><strong>Instant Payments</strong>. Lightning-fast blockchain payments without worrying about block confirmation times. Security is enforced by blockchain smart-contracts without creating a on-blockchain transaction for individual payments. Payment speed measured in milliseconds to seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>. Capable of millions to billions of transactions per second across the network. Capacity blows away legacy payment rails by many orders of magnitude. Attaching payment per action/click is now possible without custodians.</p>
<p><strong>Low Cost</strong>. By transacting and settling off-blockchain, the Lightning Network allows for exceptionally low fees, which allows for emerging use cases such as instant micropayments.</p>
<p><strong>Cross Blockchains</strong>. Cross-chain atomic swaps can occur off-chain instantly with heterogeneous blockchain consensus rules. So long as the chains can support the same cryptographic hash function, it is possible to make transactions across blockchains without trust in 3rd party custodians.</p>
