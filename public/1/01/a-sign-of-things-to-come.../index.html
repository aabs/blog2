<p><strong>Lots of baby clothes</strong></p>
<p>It gives me the shivers - I see a future littered with drying stinky babies romper suits. Our neat and minimalist, and even quite stylishly modern on a good day, existence is about to become very biological. Not that I mind - I also see myself becoming virtually American in my capacity for maudlin sentimentality about fatherhood.</p>
<p>Like I said - very biological.</p>
