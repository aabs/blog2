      <p>It&rsquo;s taken a long time, and nearly 300 blog posts (and probably a cross link or two from <a href="http://notgartner.wordpress.com">Mitch</a> whose site stats make me very envious) But &ldquo;The Wandering Glitch&rdquo; has finally made its way to the first page of Google results for searches on &ldquo;<em>Andrew Matthews</em>&rdquo; which considering how common the name is made me very happy. I sit behind my namesake, who is the artist and author of the excellent book &ldquo;Being Happy&rdquo;. I can live with that.</p>
<p>I doubt you&rsquo;d find me if you did a search for C# or Computer Science though. So I&rsquo;ll keep going&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for reading the blog! I hope you enjoy the content. Let me know which topics interest you most.</p>
