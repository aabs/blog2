This is me with Giganotosaurus, or as he is otherwise known &ldquo;<em>The Great Southern Lizard</em>&rdquo;, discovered recently in Argentina. He is a scary looking bugger. Where T-Rex would weigh in at about 6 tons of teeth and muscle, Giganotosaurus weighed at 8 tonnes. He had 15cm teeth, and was around 13 meters from the tip of his ferocious maw to the end of his whip-like tail. He could swallow grown men whole with ease, and could probably catch them even if they were in a jeep.</p>
