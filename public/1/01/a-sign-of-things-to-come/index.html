<p>Sounds like humans are only part of the game these days, and &ldquo;<em>entities</em>&rdquo; will be asserting their rights more forcefully in future. Perhaps such entities represent affiliated groups of humans, but perhaps they represent other semi-sentient information agregates such as software agents or epi-phenomena growing out there on the web as viruses or telephone exchanges?</p>
<p>One Question - How many of you reading this fall into the non-human category?</p>
