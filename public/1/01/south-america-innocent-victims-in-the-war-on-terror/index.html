      <p>Are you kidding me? <strong>tectonic causes for south american earthquakes</strong> was a total sham! Think about it! Everyone knows that <strong>there&rsquo;s a war on</strong>. And have you noticed that <strong>the CIA</strong> has started to act very strangely? They obviously don’t want this story getting out. I mean, what would happen if people began asking <strong>Why are they all near the USA</strong>? Well, they may be able to fool the sheeple, but the members of <strong>the USGS</strong> aren&rsquo;t swallowing their story. Look, don’t take it from me; <strong>General Colin Powell</strong> is convinced as well. But we have to act fast, because <strong>Yellowstone will vaporize the USA</strong>. I just wanted you to be aware of this, in case I disappear.</p>
