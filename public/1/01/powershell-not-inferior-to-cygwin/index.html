      <p>In a previous <a href="http://aabs.wordpress.com/2007/02/02/why-open-source-software-development-environments-are-crap/">post</a>, I kinda outed myself as a lover of &ldquo;find | xargs&rdquo; and grep. It <a href="http://digg.com/programming/Why_open_source_software_development_environments_are_crap">seems</a> that I inadvertantly gave offence to Jeffrey Snover (the architect of powershell), for whom I have great respect. So I thought I ought to set the record straight.</p>
<p>I like powershell a lot, and I suspect that it was familiarity with Unix that drove me back to Cygwin. I was truly inspired by the Channel9 interview that Jeffrey Snover gave. I had a few problems with the way that Cygwin handled NT file security settings, that caused me no end of grief. So I was more than happy to take powershell for a spin.  I think the idea of having an object pipeline is serendipitous, and I particularly like the fact that I am dealing with the .NET framework. I&rsquo;ve been working with that for years so I don&rsquo;t have a huge learning curve to ascend in that regard.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the reason I struggled is apropos to what I was discussing in the original post - a relative lack of documentation. I like to be able to read around a topic. To get a lot of people&rsquo;s ideas. I initially found it hard to get started - I didn&rsquo;t have a sense, at times, of the capabilities of powershell, and where I should turn to for things that I knew how to do in bash. I was tryinig out the beta version of monad which was a while back, so things may have changed. I have to try again.</p>
<p>Another reason why I opted to go back to cygwin - I get pretty much all of the mainstream Gnu utilities for free. It didn&rsquo;t occur to me that with a little fiddling I could have the best of both worlds by accessing Cygwin from within powershell. I haven&rsquo;t tried it yet, but once I have, I shall report back with instructions.</p>
