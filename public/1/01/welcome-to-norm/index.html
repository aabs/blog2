      <p>This brand new blog is where I (Andrew Matthews) and any other volunteers that join the project will post on issue involved in the production of nORM.</p>
<p>As the name suggests nORM is another .NET ORM system. The open source market seems to be flooded with them, so why release another? nORM started out life as a piece of infratsructure for a project I did a few years back when there wasn&rsquo;t anything worth having in the .NET market. I had just finished doing some Java development for a client using Torque and had found it such a labour saving device that I didn&rsquo;t feel I could live without it. When I moved over to C# I couldn&rsquo;t find anything comparable so I developed one based on the designs publicised by Scott Ambler. The ORM had a very powerful and extensible code generation system that allowed me to generate everything from SQL statements, entities and remoting specifications to basic datagrids for ASP.NET. All in all I was very impressed with what it did, but even more enthused with what was possible in a productised system.</p>
<p>In a subsequent project for Avanade and LloydsTSB share Registrars I was involved in choosing an ORM system that would see really _huge_ transaction rates. As an exercise, and not really expecting it to rate very highly, I included my old ORM system in the comparison, and was pleasantly surprised to find that rather than being a rank outsider, it came out just shy of the leaders in my comparisons. I didn&rsquo;t use it, because of the lack of support (I have just moved to the other side of the world!) but it made me realise that nORM could be a world beating system that could if productised be an essential tool in any .NET developers arsenal of APIs.</p>
<p>The core code generation system is potentially usable in a variety of other applications as well - I used it to great effect in AabsDbc (<a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/aabsdbc)">http://www.sf.net/projects/aabsdbc)</a>.</p>
<p>So I decided that I don&rsquo;t have time to do it all by myself (I have twins on the way, and can&rsquo;t see myself having the brain-power to get much coding done in my spare time for a year or so) so I&rsquo;m opening it up to the world, in the hope that there are people out there who DO have the time, and interest to get into developing a good ORM system. God knows, there&rsquo;s plenty yet to do!</p>
