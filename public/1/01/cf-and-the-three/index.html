      <p>We went to the genetics department the other day to get the doctors opinion on our likelihood of having a baby with Cystic Fibrosis. We are glad (very glad) to announce that the chances of us having a child with CF is something in the region of <em>1</em> in <em>22,000.</em> Compare that to the odds that two strangers would conceive a child with CF which is something like <em>1</em> in <em>625</em>.</p>
<p>So all in all we just have to worry about the cummulative effect of all those years sitting in front of VDUs talking on mobile phones, drinking coffee to cope with hangovers in tight jeans and Y-fronts.</p>
<p>Did I say Y-fronts? I meant Armani briefs of course.</p>
