        <p><a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/">Semantic Overflow</a> has been active for a couple of weeks. We now have 155 <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/users">users</a> and 53 <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions">questions</a>. We&rsquo;ve already had some very interesting questions and some excellent detailed and thoughtful responses. I thought, on Egon&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/245/who-set-up-this-website-and-how-can-we-reach-him-her">instigation</a>, to  bring together, from the site&rsquo;s BI stats, some of the highlights of last week.</p>
<p>The best loved question this week came from <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/users/12/jerven">Jerven Bolleman</a> who wanted to know whether there was a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/235/simple-cli-useable-owl-reasoner">Simple CLI useable OWL Reasoner</a>&rdquo;. The most popular answer (and highest voted answer) came from <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/users/140/ivan">Ivan Herman</a> who provided tool suggestions, guidance and insights into the current research directions.</p>
<p>The most viewed question was from <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/users/79/patternexon">Akshat Shrivastava</a> who asked &ldquo;<a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/228/how-do-i-make-my-homepage-personal-blog-semantic">How do I make my homepage/personal blog semantic ?</a>&rdquo;. This question garnered 5 very good answers, including a particularly good one from <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/users/69/billroberts">Bill Roberts</a>, who provided a lot of detail on his own experiences of doing just that.</p>
<p>The highest voted answer was from <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/users/103/egon-willighagen">Egon Willighagen</a> in answer to a question by &lsquo;<a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/users/61/dusoft">dusoft</a>&rsquo; as to &ldquo;<a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/203/why-launching-semanticoverflow-with-too-little-users-with-zero-reputation-sucks">Why launching SemanticOverflow with too little users with zero reputation sucks?&rdquo;</a>. He very helpfully explained how to bootstrap your reputation and make a success of the site. I&rsquo;m glad to say that dusoft&rsquo;s was the only negative comment so far, and that the general response of other site users has been very positive. Mike McClintock even told me that &ldquo;<em>SemanticOverflow is my new favorite thing</em>&rdquo;. Thanks, Mike, I hope it stays that way!</p>
<p>In terms of gathering reputation, <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/users/56/ian-davis">Ian Davis</a> of Talis is the clear front runner with the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/64/what-data-would-be-most-valuable-as-linked-data">What data would be most valuable as Linked Data?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/193/can-atom-be-considered-linked-data">Can Atom be considered Linked Data?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/94/how-can-we-make-it-easier-to-work-with-linked-data">How can we make it easier to work with Linked Data?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/182/marking-up-a-table-with-rdfa">Marking up a table with RDFa</a></li>
</ul>
<p>He also provided 17 very good answers. Thanks, Ian, and thanks to all the others who are already making Semantic Overflow a great site!</p>
