<p>Update: yes, word posts OK to Wordpress, but it uses the default value for DateTime jan 1st 1970. So you have to manually enter the timestamp within WordPress. You also have to set your own categories within Wordpress. And lastly - don&rsquo;t even think about using formatted code from a pretty printer like <a href="http://puzzleware.net/codehtmler/">http://puzzleware.net/codehtmler/</a>. The output is disastrous!</p>
