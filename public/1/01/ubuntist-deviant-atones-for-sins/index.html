        <p>Some time back I wrote  a <a href="http://aabs.wordpress.com/2005/12/02/quote-of-the-day-3/">quote of the day</a>: <em>There is no greater joy than soaring high on the wings of your dreams, except maybe the joy of watching a dreamer who has nowhere to land but in the ocean of reality.</em> For a moment I though the quote was apropos for Alec Clew&rsquo;s announcement of his apostasy, but after a moment&rsquo;s reflection I realize that it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Alec <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2007/06/24/i-might-have-to-go-back-to-the-dark-side/">wrote</a> the other day that, due to driver problems, he was thinking that he may have to depart the sunlit pastures of Gnu/Linux to return to the dreary halls of Windows XP. If you&rsquo;ve noticed any of the censure I&rsquo;ve directed towards Alec&rsquo;s perverse habits (disgusting admissions of Ubuntism and flagrantly exhibitionist open-sourcism) over the last year, then you might think that there would be a spiteful little gleam in my eye. But I have admit I&rsquo;m saddened. We are nearly at a point where we can perform painless .NET development entirely within a Gnu/Linux environment. It would be a sad thing if that were not possible because of hardware support shortcomings, rather than the quality of the toolset (which should be the only deciding factor).</p>
