      <p>Well, EDS seemed grim-in-the-extreme, they want someone to spend two months writing some godawful burocratic change request document for some Telstra billing department. I think that my facial expression may have hinted at the miasmic feeling of despondency and depression I felt at the prospect of having to wade neck-deep through so much pointless paper. I doubt I&rsquo;ll hear back from them, especially after asking to see one of their documents to check the level of design they wanted from me - only to discover that <em>there was none!!!</em></p>
<p>So, anyway, I decided to extend my contract for another month here at Telstra. Was that a true cowardly manouver, or just a trouble and dull-learning-curve avoidance manouver?</p>
