        <p><a href="http://olddogsnewtrick.blogspot.com">Tony</a> says he&rsquo;s had a hard time persuading Portals to &lsquo;get&rsquo; the advantages of Web2.0. I guess the portals would get Web2.0 from a usability perspective. It makes sense for them not to divert a little effort to it - most of Web2.0 can be built for very little cost on top of existing functionality (it&rsquo;s not rocket science after all!) But then - some of them have been around long enough to want to try to fall into the &lsquo;bank&rsquo; category - i.e. safe, well established, not fly-by-night, hands rather than vapour-ware selling, hysterical, flipperty-gibbets that sound cool but are actually teflon to users. Perhaps by being conservative the portals are hoping avoid the share-price re-adjustment (collapse) that will inevitably come after web2.0 gets exposed as a minor technical fusion rather than the major technological quantum leap that all of it&rsquo;s evangelists would have us believe!</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t personally stand expending my web-time on a site with only one concept - the signal-to-noise ratio is too low. I prefer web2.0 sites like wikipedia where there is content worth reading rather than the banal opinions of strangers.</p>
<p>I enjoyed venting these opinions so much I decided to blog them ;-) Perhaps that&rsquo;s the appeal of blogging - it&rsquo;s cathartic. Maybe it&rsquo;s like undressing in a remote place - there&rsquo;s always the thrill that you might get caught by someone.</p>
