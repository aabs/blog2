      <p>It sounds like Daniel Tammet is anything but an idiot, but he is definitely an autistic savant. His insight into his abilities are described in this fascinating <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,,1409903,00.html">article</a> in the Guardian.</p>
<p>Daniel&rsquo;s facility with languages and figures reminds me of a man called Shiva who I met in Goa last year. Shiva is not not in any way mentally disabled, but he is fluent in 15 languages (last time I asked - probably more now). That sounds like savant capabilities to me. He has the most healthy mind I have ever had the privilege to encounter. With my tight subject focus, I almost feel autistic in comparison. [sigh]</p>
