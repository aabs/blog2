      <p><a href="http://notgartner.wordpress.com/2008/05/13/care-factor/">Prompted</a> by <a href="http://notgartner.wordpress.com">Mitch Denny</a> who was in turn <a href="http://www.paulstovell.com/blog/whats-your-circle-of-interest">prompted</a> by <a href="http://www.paulstovell.com">Paul Stovell</a>, I am also exercising my Smart Art prowess in the name of proclaiming what I love, declaiming what I respect, and mentioning what I&rsquo;d rather sweep under the carpet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always found the world of software development, like much else in life and the world of work, to be a dynamic tension between the utterly mundane and the downright dreary. My solution to the tedium of my working life is to try to find significance in what I do. Naturally, that leads me towards the abstract away from the specific. You&rsquo;re not going to find any products or APIs on this list, they&rsquo;re too ephemeral - too tied up in the mundane business of making a living. I want to give you a list of the ideas that got me out of bed, not the tools that kept me from it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ideas</strong></em> are what really lights my candle. Ideas give you a framework for thinking about the world - or those bits of it you model. When I&rsquo;m trying to give junior developers or lay-people an insight into what I love about programming and computer science, I normally tell them: <em><strong>Programming is cool because no matter how dull the task you&rsquo;re performing, if you scratch the surface you can find deep and beautiful ideas.</strong></em> I pity those who, only in it for the money, don&rsquo;t see the hidden beauty in what they do.</p>
<p><a href="%7Bstatic%7D2008/05/clip-image0016.png"><img src="%7Bstatic%7D2008/05/clip-image0016-thumb.png" alt="clip\_image001\[6\]">{width=&ldquo;625&rdquo; height=&ldquo;607&rdquo;}</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing a bit about functional programming, LINQ and Semantic Web technologies lately, and I hesitated even to put <em>them</em> in. If I read this post 10 years from now, would I care about the fads and factions that entertains us so much at the moment? I doubt it. I do think that Web 3.0 will be the everyday paradigm for development and I&rsquo;ll still be getting a kick out of things like LINQ that are mathematical structures thinly veiled as language features.</p>
<p>If I could jump forward ten years from now, I&rsquo;d be pleasantly surprised at the declarative and intentional power latent in the average statement I&rsquo;ll be writing. I get much more done using hybrid techniques in C# in 2008 than I ever got done using ATL on C++ in 1998. My core passions now are what will give rise to - or still be central to - the programming paradigms of the second and third decades of the 21st century. I hope I&rsquo;m still around and programming then.</p>
<p>OK. That&rsquo;s my 2c. I&rsquo;d like to hear what the following folks care about: Derek Matthews, Richard Luckman, Matthew Hellicar, Dom De Vitto, and Andreas Peifke.</p>
<p>Sadly, none of them write blogs or have web presences outside of Flickr. I wonder whether that will be any different in 10 year&rsquo;s time? Perhaps they will reply to this if they read blogs instead&hellip;</p>
