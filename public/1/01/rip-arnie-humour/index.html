        <p>My blogging has been pretty sporadic of late. My evenings have been spent working on a long SPARQL tutorial for IBM. It&rsquo;s just going through the last editorial reviews now (with the good folks at <a href="http://www.backstopmedia.com/">Backstop Media</a>) and should be published in a day or two.</p>

<p>Bob and Troy at Backstop are great editors, and their suggestions have kept the tutorial focused and much easier to understand. But I just had to find somewhere to put this snippet that they&rsquo;ve asked me to cut. I know it&rsquo;s unrelated to the tutorial, but it made me laugh.</p>

<p>Arnie fans will know that, when presented with this question, it&rsquo;s wise to lie. Joseki is faithful to a fault.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s just hope that Joseki wasn&rsquo;t planning on spending the evening in with her boyfriend:</p>

<p>Let this be the last resting place of my daft attempts to make SPARQL funny.</p>
