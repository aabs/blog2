<p>These people are those on the very far left of the bell curve. Here&rsquo;s an interesting calculation. How many people in the world have access to email? I don&rsquo;t know, but lets assume about 1B. 1 in twenty of those represents a figure of 20M. If I could get a dollar from each of these people, I would be rich indeed. I could retire to Nigeria&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a tax on stupidity, and should be encouraged. Question: Is it possible to be stupid and cynical at the same time? Stupid and Bitter - yes. Stupid and cynical? I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
