      <p>When I started implementing the SPARQL support in LINQ to RDF, I decided that I needed to implement as much of the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/8/6/5868081c-68aa-40de-9a45-a3803d8134b8/standard_query_operators.doc">standard query operators</a> as possible. SPARQL is a very rich query language that bears a passing syntactical resemblance to SQL. It didn&rsquo;t seem unreasonable to expect most of the operators of LINQ to SQL to be usable with SPARQL. With this post I thought I&rsquo;d pass on a few design notes that I have gathered during the work to date on the SPARQL query provider.</p>
<p>The different components of a LINQ query get converted into successive calls to your query class. My class is called SparqlQuery&lt;T&gt;. If you had a query like this:</p>
<pre><code>[TestMethod]
public void SparqlQueryOrdered()
{
    string urlToRemoteSparqlEndpoint = @&quot;http://someUri&quot;;
    TripleStore ts = new TripleStore();
    ts.EndpointUri = urlToRemoteSparqlEndpoint;
    ts.QueryType = QueryType.RemoteSparqlStore;
    IRdfQuery&lt;Track&gt; qry = new RDF(ts).ForType&lt;Track&gt;();
    var q = from t in qry
        where t.Year == 2006 &amp;&amp;
        t.GenreName == &quot;History 5 | Fall 2006 | UC Berkeley&quot;
        orderby t.FileLocation
        select new {t.Title, t.FileLocation};
    foreach(var track in q){
        Trace.WriteLine(track.Title + &quot;: &quot; + track.FileLocation);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This would roughly equate to the following code, using the extension method syntax:</p>
<pre><code>[TestMethod]
public void SparqlQueryOrdered()
{
    ParameterExpression t;
    string urlToRemoteSparqlEndpoint = http://someUri;
    TripleStore ts = new TripleStore();
    ts.EndpointUri = urlToRemoteSparqlEndpoint;
    ts.QueryType = QueryType.RemoteSparqlStore;
    var q = new RDF(ts).ForType&lt;Track&gt;()
        .Where&lt;Track&gt;(/*create expression tree*/)
        .OrderBy&lt;Track, string&gt;(/*create  expression tree*/)
        .Select(/*create  expression tree*/;
    foreach (var track in q)
    {
        Trace.WriteLine(track.Title + &quot;: &quot; + track.FileLocation);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The bold red method calls are the succession of calls to the query&rsquo;s CreateQuery method. That might not be immediately obvious from looking at the code. In fact it&rsquo;s downright unobvious! There&rsquo;s compiler magic going on in this, that you don&rsquo;t see. Anyway, what happens is that you end up getting a succession of calls into your IQueryable&lt;T&gt;.CreateQuery() method. And that&rsquo;s what we are mostly concerned about when creating a query provider.</p>
<p>The last I blogged about the CreateQuery method I gave a method with a switch statement that identified the origin of the call (i.e. Where, OrderBy, Select or whatever) and dispatched the call off to be immediately processed. I now realise that that is not the best way to do it. If I try to create my SPARQL query in one pass, I will not have much of a chance to perform optimization or disambiguation. If I generate the projection before I know what fields were important, I would probably end up having to get everything back and filter on receipt of all the data. I think Bart De Smet was faced with that problem with LINQ to LDAP (LDAP doesn&rsquo;t support projections) so he had to get everything back. SPARQL does support projections, and that means I can&rsquo;t generate the SPARQL query string till after I know what to get back from the Select call.</p>
<p>My solution to this is to keep all the calls into the CreateQuery in a Hashtable so that I can use them all together in the call to GetEnumerator. That gives me the chance to do any amount of analysis on the expression trees I&rsquo;ve got stored, before I convert them into a SPARQL query. The CreateQuery method now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>protected Dictionary&lt;string, MethodCallExpression&gt; expressions;

public IQueryable&lt;S&gt; CreateQuery&lt;S&gt;(Expression expression)
{
    SparqlQuery&lt;S&gt; newQuery = CloneQueryForNewType&lt;S&gt;();

    MethodCallExpression call = expression as MethodCallExpression;
    if (call != null)
    {
        Expressions[call.Method.Name] = call;
    }
    return newQuery;
}
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://11011.net/software/vspaste"></a></p>
<p>This approach helps because it makes it much simpler to start adding the other query operators.</p>
<p>I also been doing a fair bit of tidying up as I go along. My GetEnumerator method now reflects the major grammatical components of the SPARQL spec for SELECT queries.</p>
<pre><code>private void CreateQuery(StringBuilder sb)
{
    if(Expressions.ContainsKey(&quot;Where&quot;))
    {
        // first parse the where expression to get the list of parameters to/from the query.
        StringBuilder sbTmp = new StringBuilder();
        ParseQuery(Expressions[&quot;Where&quot;].Parameters[1], sbTmp);
        //sbTmp now contains the FILTER clause so save it somewhere useful.
        Query = sbTmp.ToString();
        // now store the parameters where they can be used later on.
        queryGraphParameters.AddAll(Parser.Parameters);
    }
    CreateProlog(sb);
    CreateDataSetClause(sb);
    CreateProjection(sb);
    CreateWhereClause(sb);
    CreateSolutionModifier(sb);
}
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://11011.net/software/vspaste"></a>The If clause checks whether the query had a where clause. If it did, it parses it, creating the FILTER expression, and in the process gathering some valuable information about what members from T were referenced in the where clause. This information is useful for other tasks, so it gets done in advance of creating the Where clause.</p>
