Child Linguistic Development is a document that I wrote when I was at university on the stages of language development. Since Emily and Thomas are now a week short of 18 months it is time for Kerry and I to start learning about learning.

I&rsquo;ve put a link in to kerry&rsquo;s gorgeous new blog/journal, where she describes her day-to-day experiences of raising twins.">
