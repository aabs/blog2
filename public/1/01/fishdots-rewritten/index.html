      <p>Fishdots v1 and its plugins were groaning under their own weight. It&rsquo;s in-memory
function definitions model, inherited from before it was even a fishy thing, led
to some serious load time lag. Combine that with extensive use of tmux, and you
have a recipe for frustration!</p>
<p>The repo <a href="http://github.com/aabs/fishdots2">fishdots2</a> ports everything over to
use the inate autoloading capabilities of fish shell. In the process of the
rewrite, I&rsquo;ve taken the chance to break it up, and make it simpler and more
clearly focused.</p>
<p>It now has these roles:</p>
<ol>
<li>auto-run user and machine supplied dotfiles during shell startup</li>
<li>provide logging functions</li>
<li>simple autoenv style functionality</li>
<li>simple file finding, selection and searching</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything else that it used to do is now gone.  This includes installers, plugin commands etc.  In future just use fisher or omf.  It&rsquo;s still needed as a common foundation for the other plugins, and may help you if you plan to make some fish shellplugins of you own.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, expect more plugins to be released, as I port existing fishdots v1 plugins over.</p>
