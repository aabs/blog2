I took this photo a few weeks ago. Kerry still keeps on growing. She&rsquo;s already bigger than some of her friends when they were at full term. It&rsquo;s getting a bit uncomfortable for her now. I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time giving her foot rubs now! Not that I mind - she has perfect feet, or at least that&rsquo;s what she keeps telling me.">
