      <p>*The wombat lives across the seas,
Among the far Antipodes.
He may exist on nuts and berries,
Or then again, on missionaries;
His distant habitat precludes
Conclusive knowledge of his moods.
But I would not engage the wombat
In any form of mortal combat.
&ndash; &ldquo;The Wombat&rdquo;

<p>I saw something streak past my driveway the other night. It ran in a manner not unlike a chimp, or baboon - on all fours with a two-by-two gait. It was moving fast enough that it couldn&rsquo;t have been an escaping dwarf or baby. It had no tail, and was kind of compact. Needless to say I abstained from leaping after it into the dark, preferring to remain ignorant of the capabilities of your wombat in a fair fight.</p>
