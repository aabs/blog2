        <p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been exploring old prototype code I wrote year ago. It always amazes me to se how my coding style changes over the years. It also intrigues me, because it&rsquo;s a kind of cross between archeology and journaling. I can see what I was doing years ago. I wrote this little C++ memory simulation back in 2002, for a the memory component of a little CPU simulator:</p>
<p><code>struct memory { byte_t* mem; unsigned int size;``memory(unsigned int x = vpc::mem_size)   {   mem = new byte_t[x];   size = x;   //memset(mem, 0, size);   } ~memory()   {   if(mem != 0)     {     delete mem;     mem = 0;     size = 0;     }   }</code></p>
<p>template&lt;typename T&gt;
T get(unsigned int idx)
  {
  return *(T*)(mem + idx);
  }</p>
<p>template&lt;typename T&gt;
T get(unsigned int base, unsigned int off)
  {
  return get(base + off);
  }</p>
<p>template&lt;typename T&gt;
void set(unsigned int idx, T&amp; t)
  {
  *(T*)(mem + idx) = t;
  }
};
It&rsquo;s easy to see how C++ grew out of Simula. There&rsquo;s very little difference here between a simulation and the real thing. This could be part of a primitive memory manager if you enhanced it a little. It grabs a piece of memory, and then treats it as though it were a T. I just used the get and set methods to allow me to easily manipulate C++ data types from a test harness. I can only think of two ways to do this in C#. First was the MemoryStream class, that would allow you to serialize your objects into and out of [memory]{style=&ldquo;font-family:Courier New;&rdquo;}, and the other would be the BitConverter class. BitConverter would be more efficient, but only supports primitive types. A serialized class is not much use at runtime, since you would have to deserialize it to use it.</p>
<p>I like this because it illustrates how a strongly typed language can be a hindrance. Last time I posted an entry criticising C# for lacking the power of C++, I got back some very intriguing responses that showed that with sufficient ingenuity, you can get around most hurdles in a language. So this time, I&rsquo;m wondering how we could overcome this strong typing constraint. I know I&rsquo;m a hypocrite for eulogising about strong typing in one post, and then criticising it in the very next. I guess I just want the power to not be bound by it, if I know what I am doing.</p>
<p>This must be an issue for C# communications libraries where they need to efficiently convert a byte stream into an object. Since all objects and classes are ultimately composed of primitives, I have to assume that recursive application of the BitConverter class is enough to impose shape on the data stream - but you would have to assign an object on a heap to store the data, so you can&rsquo;t do what is done above.</p>
<p>How would you do this in C#?</p>
