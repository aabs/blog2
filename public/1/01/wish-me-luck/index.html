      <p>I have an interview with EDS, a large consultancy company for a Telstra-inspired short term project. I was beginning to wonder whether all I was ever going to get was phone calls from strangers wanting to be my best mate, or prove to me that they are <em>wankers</em>. Why do they always want to meet me&hellip;I can&rsquo;t make out whether they are play-acting business, or whether they believe that knowing what I look like might make my resume more believable than it is. Perhaps it is a kind of bonding process that they think will make me a more nutritious parasitic host.</p>
<p>If money is the lubricant of the economy and recruitment agents are the lubricants of structural unemployment, then the people I have been dealing with are the <em>loose pocket change of economic churn.</em></p>
<p>As for EDS - I suspect a short term contract would be better than signing up for a full time job with a company like ThoughtWorks, even though ThoughtWorks seem to set a higher standard than normal and may be fun to work for. What do you think? Should I go for another contract or take a good permie job that pays a lot less?</p>
