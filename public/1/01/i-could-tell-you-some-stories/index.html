      <p>A new &lsquo;chutist had just jumped from the plane at 10,000 feet, and soon
discovered that all his lines were hopelessly tangled. At about 5,000 feet,
still struggling, he noticed someone coming up from the ground at about the same
speed as he was going towards the ground. As they passed each other at 3,000
feet, the &lsquo;chutist yells, &ldquo;HEY! DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PARACHUTES?&rdquo; The
reply came, fading towards the end, &ldquo;NO! DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT COLEMAN
STOVES?&rdquo;</p>
