That got me to thinking, if you can entrain your brainwaves deliberately to give you more vitality and concentration, isn&rsquo;t it possible to accidentally find yourself in an environment that has the opposite effect on you?">

      <p><a href="http://aymeric.gaurat.net/tech/Default.aspx">Aymeric</a> put me onto a cool application called <a href="http://www.transparentcorp.com/products/np/">Neuro Programmer 2</a> (from the sinister sounding Transparent Corporation – makes me think of Umbrella Corporation), that generates brainwave entrainment sessions. We tried out one called <a href="http://anabubula.com/node/26">Caffeine Replacement</a>, and were quite amazed at the effect it had on us. We both ended up euphoric afterwards.</p>
<p>That got me to thinking, if you can entrain your brainwaves deliberately to give you more vitality and concentration, isn&rsquo;t it possible to accidentally find yourself in an environment that has the opposite effect on you? I wonder whether the distinctive sounds of computer fans, air conditioning, strip lights and conversational hubbub in an open plan office can combine to have a suppressive brainwave entrainment effect. Maybe that contributes to sick building syndrome?</p>
<p>Imagine how cool it might be to be able to use your laptop&rsquo;s speakers to modulate the background noise to put you in the frame of mind you require. You could have a menu in the system tray with options like [Receptive &amp; Creative], [Relaxed], [Energetic]. I would like that.</p>
