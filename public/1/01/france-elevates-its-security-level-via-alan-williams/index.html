      <p>As many of you may be aware, in light of the current nightly disturbances occurring all over France, the French government has just announced a raise in its terror alert level from &ldquo;Run&rdquo; to &ldquo;Hide&rdquo;. The normal level is &ldquo;General Arrogance&rdquo;, and the only two higher levels in France are &ldquo;Surrender&rdquo; and &ldquo;Collaborate&rdquo;. The rise was precipitated by a recent arsonist fire that destroyed France&rsquo;s white flag factory in an ethnic suburb of Paris, effectively paralyzing the country&rsquo;s military capability.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only the French that are on a heightened level of alert: Italy has increased the alert level from &ldquo;Shout loudly and excitedly&rdquo; to &ldquo;Elaborate military posturing&rdquo;. Two more levels remain, &ldquo;Ineffective combat operations&rdquo; and &ldquo;Change sides&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Germans also increased their alert state from &ldquo;Disdain&rdquo; to &ldquo;Dress in uniform and sing marching songs&rdquo;. They have two higher levels: &ldquo;Invade a neighbour&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lose&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Seeing this reaction in continental Europe the Americans have gone from &ldquo;Isolationism&rdquo; to &ldquo;Find another oil-rich nation for regime change&rdquo;. Their remaining higher alert states are &ldquo;Attack random countries (ideally those without any credible military)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beg the British for help&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The British are also feeling the pinch in relation to recent bombings and have raised their security level from &ldquo;Miffed&rdquo; to &ldquo;Peeved&rdquo;. Soon though, security levels may be raised yet again to &ldquo;Irritated&rdquo; or even &ldquo;A Bit Cross&rdquo;. Londoners have not been &ldquo;A Bit Cross&rdquo; since the Blitz in 1940 when tea supplies all but ran out. Terrorists have been re-categorized from &ldquo;Tiresome&rdquo; to &ldquo;Bloody Nuisance&rdquo;. The last time the British issued a &ldquo;Bloody Nuisance&rdquo; warning level was during the Great Fire of 1666.</p>
