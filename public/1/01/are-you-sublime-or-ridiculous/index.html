        <p>Sometimes I wonder at the simplicity of us humans. Its often hard to see the simplicity though, when we act in such complex ways, but I think the following describes our &lsquo;<em>behaviour</em>&rsquo; quite succinctly.</p>
<p>$latex .8x/x^\frac{8-x}{x}&amp;s=2$</p>
<p>Pretty simple huh? Well it looks a bit like this when you draw a graph:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/147/430239182_a7646af48b_o_d.png" alt=""></p>
<p>See what I mean? You sate a need, and over time its intensity increases till it starts to get unbearable. Obviously this graph represents my dependency on caffeine, and is based on entirely randomly chosen numbers, scales &amp; so on. But you get the picture? It&rsquo;s fairly indicative of how we react if we don&rsquo;t attend to our needs over time.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why (in addition to taking a rather dismal tone in this post) on earth I felt the urge to create such a model. Well the answer is (in addition to giving me a chance to play with gnuplot, mathomatic and $latex \LaTeX&amp;s=-2$ all in the one post) that I&rsquo;m producing the rules to go with the little Freudian drive ontology I showed you in my previous <a href="http://aabs.wordpress.com/2007/03/21/domain-modeling-and-ontology-engineering/">post</a>. There, in the 20-odd lines of <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/">N3 notation</a>, I was able to produce a nice little model of our baser urges - what you might call our reptilian heritage :-)</p>
<p>What amuses me is that we can describe such deeply felt aspects of our personalities in such simple terms. I mean, that equation earlier wasn&rsquo;t that complex was it? It&rsquo;s not like it needed quaternions or new fields of analysis! It reminds me of a blog post I read a few months back by some guy who&rsquo;d discovered how to initiate a transition in the state model of his grizzly daughter. Whenever she started to cry, and he or his wife couldn&rsquo;t console her, they put her into her cot. After a while she forgot why she was crying (remember FSAs are stateless:) and so when they lifted her out of her cot, she immediately thought she&rsquo;d gotten what she wanted and stopped crying. She&rsquo;d transitioned from <em><strong>in_cot</strong></em>/[Cry] to the <em><strong>out_of_cot</strong></em>/[Smile] state.  It also made me remember that the common house-fly&rsquo;s visual navigation algorithm is about as complex as the equation I just gave. It&rsquo;s not that the algorithm is complex, but that the environment it reacts to is.</p>
<p>So, are <em><strong>you</strong></em> a meaty algorithm, or the pinnacle of god&rsquo;s creation? Me? I&rsquo;m just off for a coffee and a fag, before going to sleep. :-)</p>
