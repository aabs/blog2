<p>StackOverflow has been an overnight sensation because it combines many of the traditional features of wikis, newgroups and social media platforms combined with a reputation system that promotes community involvement and high quality discussion. I&rsquo;m sure that as the Semantic Web starts to go exponential, Semantic Overflow will be a useful forum for more than just technical questions. I hope you&rsquo;ll use it for speculation about the directions of the field itself. Unlike StackOverflow, non-technical discussions won&rsquo;t be moderated out, provided they are on-topic. I think that in such an interesting and emerging space, discussion and dissemination of knowledge is critical. If you agree, please come and join us for a question or two.</p>
