      <div>
        
        <p>The real value of a language learning (or any other kind of learning) organ, as Chomsky called it, is that its most valuable output is the _capacity_ to be so sensitive to the environment that mental processes grow to represent it. That is, the diversity of environments that humans find themselves in is so rich and varied that a hard wired and inflexible capacity would be of limited value compared to a &ldquo;meta-learning&rdquo; facility that develops to represent the environment the organism finds itself in.</p>
<p>Meta-evolution would be of more evolutionary value than just plain evolution - a learning capacity that can evolve in the real-time of an organism&rsquo;s life seems more valuable than the simple evolution of a set of skills and competences that must be evolved over time as environments change.</p>
