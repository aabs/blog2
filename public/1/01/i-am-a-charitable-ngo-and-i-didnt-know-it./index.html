      <p>I have been receiving increasingly desperate messages from various scions of once elevated families of the Ivory Coast, Kenya and South Africa. They have all these funds tied up and the need ME to help them release it (in confidence of course, but I know you, dear reader, will not tell a soul)!</p>
<p>I feel honoured to be considered for the noble task of helping these courteous young people out of their dire circumstances. I just need a donation from you dear reader to allow me to free up the funds to send to them to free up their funds to send my cut back to me so that I can pass it on to you. Contact me for my bank account details.</p>
