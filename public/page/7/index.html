          Petri Nets are extremely powerful and expressive, but they are not as widely used in the software development community as deterministic state machines. That&rsquo;s a pity - they allow us to solve problems beyond the reach of conventional state machines. This is the first in a mini-series on software development with Petri Nets. All of the code for a full feature-complete Petri Net library is available online at GitHub. You&rsquo;re welcome to take a copy, play with it and use it in your own projects.

          I recently came across the Dryad project at MS Research. It is concerned with the development of automated systems to deploy sequential systems across parallel platforms. This is an interesting and topical issue at the moment because the advent of multi-core processors poses problems for developers. In C#, at the very least, there is no inherent parallelization of the language. Developers have to explicitly code a system with threading or grid computing in mind.

          Software svengali Alec Clews has recently delineated a methodology that brings together the best of both the Agile and Waterfall worlds into a single edible package that will keep us in work for years to come. The methodological guru said &ldquo;BDALAP recognises that certain design decisions are a) complex and b) have far reaching implications&rdquo;. The solution, he says, is to perform Big Design As Late As Possible.
Of course, an Agile exponent would say that &ldquo;as late as possible&rdquo; would be when the application proves not to scale.

          It&rsquo;s clear that the unofficial policy of both Microsoft and Google is &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t believe in the semantic web&rdquo;. It may not be clear why. The answer is unsurprising when you give it some thought, though: Big Business. Semantic search holds out the hope of users being able to compose meaningful queries and get relevant results. The price is that someone somewhere has to write down the answers in a meaningful way.

          Well, I&rsquo;m back in work - a fact that would normally be an occasion for mourning. But, at least on this occasion, I am settling in OK. I am doing a short contract for a local classified ads company called the trading post (if you&rsquo;ve ever seen the movie The Castle, you&rsquo;ll recognise the name). I will be working on redeveloping their admin back-end, and shall get more stored procedure practice than at any other time in my programming career.

          It appears that Boo has reincarnated to drag us down, once again. Of course, it won&rsquo;t be possible without the help of Aggy Finn who was with them at the time[*]{style=&ldquo;font-size:9pt;&quot;}.
This is how he escaped last time:
If the contractor wages go down to 10GBP/hr again, Aggy, I shall be blaming you!!!!!
[* Needless to say, most this is a pack of lies. Especially the bit about Aggy being responsible.

          I produced this list for Chris Palmer, who was interested in doing some background research on design patterns, design issues and programming best practice. I was planning on just jotting down some titles as they occurred to me, but when I sat down to think about all the books (of Computer Science or programming) that had inspired me, the list began to grow and grow. So I thought it might be worth committing it to a blog entry that I can refer to and extend later on.

IBM and Switzerland&rsquo;s Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) have teamed up to create the most ambitious project in the field of neuroscience: to simulate a mammalian brain on the world&rsquo;s most powerful supercomputer, IBM&rsquo;s Blue Gene. They plan to simulate the brain at every level of detail, even going down to molecular and gene expression levels of processing.
Several things come to mind after the initial &ldquo;coooooooooooooool!
