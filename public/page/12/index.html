          Funny. There really is a large Oedipal component to anti-MS zealotry. The non-alpha nerds (especially very young under graduate level or recently post graduate level nerds) presumably see Bill Gates (and Microsoft in general) in the same way as they saw their fathers when they were very young children&hellip; Bill is the ultimate competitor for all that they desire in the world of their technical explorations (mother). If they cannot displace him and his organization from the affections of mother (the PC buying, technology using public) then they learn to sublimate their hatred of him into 500 word anti-MS blog posts on sites like slashdot.

          Aymeric put me onto a cool application called Neuro Programmer 2 (from the sinister sounding Transparent Corporation – makes me think of Umbrella Corporation), that generates brainwave entrainment sessions. We tried out one called Caffeine Replacement, and were quite amazed at the effect it had on us. We both ended up euphoric afterwards.
That got me to thinking, if you can entrain your brainwaves deliberately to give you more vitality and concentration, isn&rsquo;t it possible to accidentally find yourself in an environment that has the opposite effect on you?

          I&rsquo;m blogging my progress from mid-way through the project. I have a working prototype, which is a crude implementation of what I want. It has a few limitations which require me to go back and productise it. It may seem a little arbitrary for me to describe a domain split on my second blog post, before even telling you what the requirements are. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s just that that was what I was thinking about, when I started this blog.

          [digg=http://www.digg.com/programming/Domain_Modeling_and_Ontology_Engineering] The semantic web is poised to influence us in ways that will be as radical as the early days of the Internet and World Wide Web. For software developers it will involve a paradigm shift, bringing new ways of thinking about the problems that we solve, and more-importantly bringing us new bags of tricks to play with.
One of the current favourite ways to add value to an existing system is through the application of data mining.

          <p>Another masterpiece of the art. This one even includes a little error to help
make the client feel not only blessed with good fortune at having found the
elixir but also heroically perspicatious at having found that their grammatical
capacities are as overdeveloped as their hair soon will be.</p>

          Darren Neimke posted some interesting thoughts today about the way developers lose their drive on a project, and how it&rsquo;s reflected in SCRUM meetings. He thought that it might be due to the SCRUM meetings themselves. Daniel Crowley-Wilson has another idea - the developers are just bored.
Developers relish challenges and opportunities to do new things, and solve novel problems. As Daniel says, about midway through a project, there is little novelty in the problems left to be solved.

          Perhaps the day has finally arrived when GNU/Linux seems like a viable option. Every six months or so I try out the latest GNU/Linux distros to see how they&rsquo;re progressing. I look at them from the usual jaundiced perspective of the professional programmer. Not from the naive perspective of teenage rebellion. Normally I end up wandering off in disgust at the unfinished feel of the whole ensemble.
All I want is an environment that doesn&rsquo;t fight back when I use it.

          Yes, like all the other gullible fools, with highly reactive immune systems, I have invested my hard-earned money in a mosquito-click (tm). On the tin it says that as few as five clicks will inhibit the histamine reaction and 10 clicks will also neutralise the foriegn matter injected by the insect, by denaturing any proteins in them through electric pressure.
Well, I should have guessed that if I suffered enough from the bites to pay $20, then I was gonna need a lot more than 5 clicks to eradicate the histamine.
