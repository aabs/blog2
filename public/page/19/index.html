It is a &lsquo;Ultra-High Molecular Weight Low Temperature Thermoplastic &rsquo; which is to say - a form of modelling plastic that can be made plyable at just above room temperature, and can be moulded to almost any shape, but which when it cools is hard as steel. Now I have my shed, (well I share it with Cockroaches and Huntsmen spiders and moths the size of mice, but I call it mine) and a double garage (not pronounced like Mirage but like Forage) I also have the opportunity (but not the leasure time) to get more &lsquo;practical&rsquo;.

          It&rsquo;s taken a long time, and nearly 300 blog posts (and probably a cross link or two from Mitch whose site stats make me very envious) But &ldquo;The Wandering Glitch&rdquo; has finally made its way to the first page of Google results for searches on &ldquo;Andrew Matthews&rdquo; which considering how common the name is made me very happy. I sit behind my namesake, who is the artist and author of the excellent book &ldquo;Being Happy&rdquo;.

          I received a very heart-rending letter today from a lady whose email is helenamed@i12.com (yes spiders, please use it) who needs my help. As a renowned Charitable Organisation I am now the first port of call for all such desperate people who, ridden with cancer and sadly widowed from a rich, industrious and virtuous husbands, need to transfer money out of accounts that work in very strange ways. I am ever glad to be of assistance to the rich and needy worldwide, and to do that I still need your donations readers.

          Well, Aabs Dbc is now out there in the public domain now. Yayyy!!!!!
I&rsquo;ve created an open-source project on sourceforge, and advertised there for help with documentation, installers and general app developers. I&rsquo;ve uploaded an initial source code release - and configured my paypal settings.
I can&rsquo;t wait to see how it is received by the public. Pay the site a visit, and let me know what YOU think. And, of course, if you want to make a donation&hellip; ;o)

          It seems I touched a bit of a raw nerve with Alec when I pointed out that some IDEs are less crap than others. Specifically, I was referring to the ones that have major corporate clout invested in their production. He pointed out that they require standardisation of tools within a development team as well as standardisation of APIs, SCM tools, documentation, and build tools. He also points out that they obscure information from the developer that is necessary for the proper understanding of a complex system.

          I recently ran into this problem with one of our clients. It&rsquo;s the sort of thing that I take ages to track down a solution to, and then once I have solved it, I immediately forget what the solution is. So I&rsquo;m putting it here as an aid memoire.
The client had a module that they were using to create a custom Principal object derived from a FormsPrincipal. I found that after I had converted the project to work with VS.

          It sounds like Daniel Tammet is anything but an idiot, but he is definitely an autistic savant. His insight into his abilities are described in this fascinating article in the Guardian.
Daniel&rsquo;s facility with languages and figures reminds me of a man called Shiva who I met in Goa last year. Shiva is not not in any way mentally disabled, but he is fluent in 15 languages (last time I asked - probably more now).
