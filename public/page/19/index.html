          A new &lsquo;chutist had just jumped from the plane at 10,000 feet, and soon discovered that all his lines were hopelessly tangled. At about 5,000 feet, still struggling, he noticed someone coming up from the ground at about the same speed as he was going towards the ground. As they passed each other at 3,000 feet, the &lsquo;chutist yells, &ldquo;HEY! DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PARACHUTES?&rdquo; The reply came, fading towards the end, &ldquo;NO!

          Today I had record stats on my blog. I passed the 200 hits per day threshold.
{width=&ldquo;172&rdquo; height=&ldquo;148&rdquo;}
Since Mitch Denny told me the kind of visitor numbers he got on his blog, I&rsquo;ve been operating with a bit of an inferiority complex. At the time I was peaking at about 20 hits per day and at the time I was pleased with those levels. Since then (about 4 months ago) I have been trying to attract more visitors to the blog.

It is a &lsquo;Ultra-High Molecular Weight Low Temperature Thermoplastic ' which is to say - a form of modelling plastic that can be made plyable at just above room temperature, and can be moulded to almost any shape, but which when it cools is hard as steel. Now I have my shed, (well I share it with Cockroaches and Huntsmen spiders and moths the size of mice, but I call it mine) and a double garage (not pronounced like Mirage but like Forage) I also have the opportunity (but not the leasure time) to get more &lsquo;practical&rsquo;.

          It&rsquo;s taken a long time, and nearly 300 blog posts (and probably a cross link or two from Mitch whose site stats make me very envious) But &ldquo;The Wandering Glitch&rdquo; has finally made its way to the first page of Google results for searches on &ldquo;Andrew Matthews&rdquo; which considering how common the name is made me very happy.

          I received a very heart-rending letter today from a lady whose email is helenamed@i12.com (yes spiders, please use it) who needs my help. As a renowned Charitable Organisation I am now the first port of call for all such desperate people who, ridden with cancer and sadly widowed from a rich, industrious and virtuous husbands, need to transfer money out of accounts that work in very strange ways. I am ever glad to be of assistance to the rich and needy worldwide, and to do that I still need your donations readers.

I&rsquo;ve created an open-source project on sourceforge, and advertised there for help with documentation, installers and general app developers. I&rsquo;ve uploaded an initial source code release - and configured my paypal settings.
I can&rsquo;t wait to see how it is received by the public. Pay the site a visit, and let me know what YOU think. And, of course, if you want to make a donation&hellip; ;o)

          It seems I touched a bit of a raw nerve with Alec when I pointed out that some IDEs are less crap than others. Specifically, I was referring to the ones that have major corporate clout invested in their production. He pointed out that they require standardisation of tools within a development team as well as standardisation of APIs, SCM tools, documentation, and build tools. He also points out that they obscure information from the developer that is necessary for the proper understanding of a complex system.

          I recently ran into this problem with one of our clients. It&rsquo;s the sort of thing that I take ages to track down a solution to, and then once I have solved it, I immediately forget what the solution is. So I&rsquo;m putting it here as an aid memoire.
The client had a module that they were using to create a custom Principal object derived from a FormsPrincipal. I found that after I had converted the project to work with VS.
