          This time I&rsquo;m going to show you the design pattern that I use for code generation. Generally I use this for analysis of hierarchical structures, such as assemblies or database metadata. You could use it in other scenarios, where data is less structured. If you are familiar with the operation of a SAX parser and .NET events then you&rsquo;ll have no trouble understanding the design.
SAX-like Parser A SAX parser works by iterating through its material (in this case XML, but that&rsquo;s immaterial) firing off events for everything that it finds.

          Last time I described typed and un-typed events, and multicasting events to several listeners. One of those listeners would be a code generator. This time I&rsquo;ll go on to describe some of the necessary infrastructure that such a design requires. Generally this information is all about tieing the events together. The context in which an event takes place is as important as the event itself.
When you&rsquo;re generating code progressively, you need to keep track of what you have done, and what still needs to be done.

          This time I&rsquo;m going to describe the source snippet that I posted last time. In previous posts I showed the implementation that I use of the Observer pattern to fire off events notifying the code generator about code structures that it has found. The code generator was shown last time, and you can see that there are a whole bunch of event handlers that take note of the code structures and perform code generation tasks as required.

          Recently I attempted to implement a declarative predicate checking system to allow design by contract (DBC) within C# 3.0. I was not successful due to a limitation in the kind of parameters one can pass to an Attribute constructor in .NET (no lambdas). I thought I&rsquo;d just follow that up with a simpler model based on extension methods.
public static class Predicates { public static void Assert&lt;T&gt;(this T obj, Func&lt;T, bool&gt; pred) { if (!

          The configuration of applications is a reflex action these days. Programmers assume the need for a config system without reflection and then move on to wondering howthey will implement it. I&rsquo;ve spent a bit of time lately wondering how many of these standard practices of configuration are ill-pre-conceived opinions. Do they deserve the merit that they have? I con&rsquo;t help but think that most of the times I use config it&rsquo;s out of habit, and the vague idea that it adds to my system somehow.

          Olmo made a very worthwhile suggestion on the LINQ forums recently. His suggestion was for a new operator to be added to the C# language to allow us to do away with the following kind of pesky construct:
 [sourcecode language='csharp']string x; if(a != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; a.Address != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; a.Address.FirstLine != null) x = a.Address.FirstLine;[/sourcecode]  instead he suggested a new ?. operator so that we could produce something like this:

          Well, then end of another contract looms. Telstra have been my &ldquo;hosts&rdquo; for the last few months. I would like to believe that it has not been a parasitic relationship. A parasite is &ldquo;an organism that grows, feeds, and is sheltered on or in a different organism while contributing nothing to the survival of its host&rdquo;. Sadly though, I must admit that, try as I might, I was able to contribute little more than a few (beautifully typeset) documents that were promptly applauded then ignored.

          I spent most of my evening converting Jena to .NET. Needless to say it was only at the end of the evening that I discovered that Andy Seabourne (from my old home town of Bristol) had already worked out how to use IKVM to convert the jar files into assemblies. I&rsquo;m not bothered though; I produced make files (rather than shell scripts) that work better on cygwin. The best thing I got from Andy was his &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry be happy&rdquo; advice that IKVM spuriously complains about unfound classes - you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it.
