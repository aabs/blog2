          I&rsquo;ll be doing a short introduction on LINQ tonight at the Dev SIG of Victoria.NET in Collins Street. I only have 20 minutes to talk so I won&rsquo;t be able to go into too much depth. What I do hope to do is persuade the audience that LINQ is worthy of their attention. If I can persuade a few people to go out and develop their own query providers, then even better.

          Normally I have a very optimistic outlook. Especially when it comes to technological breakthroughs. But this morning I was given pause for thought. MAKE magazine carried a news article today about a highly accurate DNA replicator for $10. I am fully convinced that such breakthroughs can be used to tackle the issues of world poverty, but I&rsquo;ve just finished reading Tomorrow&rsquo;s War by David Shukman. It was written over 10 years ago but was gloomy, even then about our chances of controlling the proliferation of expertise in the production of WMD, and it was written before 9/11.

          Dom suggested that &ldquo;The distance to our goals always seems further to those realists without sufficient knowledge.&rdquo;. My personal experience in software indicates that when you are attempting to solve a difficult problem with many unknowns, you cannot predict the degree of complexity of the problem or solution without actually solving the problem. Good estimation in a software project is an exercise in pessimism. I also find that my pessimism is never enough!

Here&rsquo;s what will go into release one:
 Configuration Use native .NET configuration Configuration Remove existing config assembly Installers WIX installers Runtime Control Add transactional support from COM+ Runtime Control Extend reverse engineering to examine SPs and create wrappers for them. Runtime Control Configurable ID strategy Runtime Control Configurable transaction isolation policy Templates Move core templates into resource assembly Testing Create a proper test database Runtime Control Divide system between runtime and development projects Runtime Control Standardise all names to CamelCase

          I&rsquo;m proud to say that I&rsquo;ve finally uploaded version 0.7 of LinqToRdf. This is by far the best release of LinqToRdf (so far), and it now contains full support for relationship navigation out of the box. Relationship support has always been possible (provided you were intimately familiar with various undocumented parts of LINQ:), but with the automated support for instance URIs that came in version 0.6, it&rsquo;s now automatic.
The high points of the release are:

          I&rsquo;m very pleased to announce the release of version 0.8 of LinqToRdf. This release is significant for a couple of reasons. Firstly, because it provides a preview release of RdfMetal and secondly because it is the first release containing changes contributed by someone other than yours truly. The changes in this instance being provided by Carl Blakeley of OpenLink Software.
LinqToRdf v0.8 has received a few major chunks of work:
