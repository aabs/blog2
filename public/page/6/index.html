          In a conversation I had with a colleague, it came to light that the British have another reason to be proud of their national heritage. As you may know, they were the nation that invented the queue. they take to the queue as ducks take to water, and queueticette is installed in their youth from the cradle. Not content with that, the British graduated in the 70s from simple linear queues to more complicated non-linear arrangements.

          This is a reminder to self, for those times when you just gotta have vim and fishdots on a recent version of fish shell (and someone upstream has completely screwed up the CA certificates so you can&rsquo;t use apt or linux brew because they can&rsquo;t be configured to relax cacert security).
First, create a place for them to live
mkdir -p ~/bin; cd /tmp Now get fish shell
wget --no-check-certificate https://download.

          This from Eurekalert: You may think that with faster internet connectivity, internet phone calls and iPods, that we&rsquo;re living in a technological nirvana. But according to a new analysis we are fast approaching a new dark age. The results show that the number of technological breakthroughs and patents peaked a century ago and have been falling steadily ever since. But this is a controversial view not held by most futurologists.

          Sometimes I wonder at the simplicity of us humans. Its often hard to see the simplicity though, when we act in such complex ways, but I think the following describes our &lsquo;behaviour&rsquo; quite succinctly.
$latex .8x/x^\frac{8-x}{x}&amp;s=2$
Pretty simple huh? Well it looks a bit like this when you draw a graph:
See what I mean? You sate a need, and over time its intensity increases till it starts to get unbearable.

          Last night Kerry and I saw the Melbourne Chorale perform Arvo Part&rsquo;s Songs of Repentance at St Patricks Cathedral. It was a beautiful concert and one I&rsquo;ll not forget in a hurry.
The music began with Allegri&rsquo;s Misereri which blew us both away, but the music continued to improve (IMHO) with the Part part. The choir sang in that gorgeous subsonic Russian orthodox christian style with edgy dissonances that fixate your attention.

          &hellip;life is pain.
And it seems that some of us (and I&rsquo;m including myself in this camp till proven otherwise) are born with an inherited tendency to feel more pain than others. This curse is known as &ldquo;primary erythromelalgia&rdquo;. And is somehow related to a defective sodium channel in the pain signalling neurons. I blame my parents.
Breaking news It seems that one of the guys that I&rsquo;m working with has a father-in-law who was a body guard for Adolph Hitler.

I was cruising around the ID3.org site looking for a .NET ID3 tag API, when I came upon AudioFiler. AudioFiler is a great application, and one I&rsquo;ve been searching for for years. Perhaps I should explain. I started creating and collecting MP3s back in about 1997, and since then my collection has grown a little. Back then there was a cool tool called TrackManager, by Nick de Jong.

<p>Proving that Cockroaches are not indestructible, Kerry neatly (if inadvertently) demonstrated that Australian port is capable of killing things that heat, cold and lethal levels of ionizing radiation cannot.</p>
<p>Of course Kerry was gagging for days just at the thought that the thing had been in her glass all along – it probably hadn’t – but I forgot to mention that anything that can kill a cockroach can surely kill the bacteria that the cockroach carries…</p>

          Petri Nets are extremely powerful and expressive, but they are not as widely used in the software development community as deterministic state machines. That&rsquo;s a pity - they allow us to solve problems beyond the reach of conventional state machines. This is the first in a mini-series on software development with Petri Nets. All of the code for a full feature-complete Petri Net library is available online at GitHub. You&rsquo;re welcome to take a copy, play with it and use it in your own projects.

          I recently came across the Dryad project at MS Research. It is concerned with the development of automated systems to deploy sequential systems across parallel platforms. This is an interesting and topical issue at the moment because the advent of multi-core processors poses problems for developers. In C#, at the very least, there is no inherent parallelization of the language. Developers have to explicitly code a system with threading or grid computing in mind.
