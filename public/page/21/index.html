<p>Ha Ha Surprise
It was all just a drunken stunt!</p>
<p>OK. no it wasn&rsquo;t, but I bet Kerry never thought, when she posed for this, that one day she would come to think of this shape as normal!</p>

          The smell of mother helps in the growth and development of a newborn child&rsquo;s olfactory centres. This is used in the process of bonding and is closely related to the way that the rest of the brain wires itself up to perceive the rest of the world. Just as I&rsquo;ve been saying for years - reality itself is the force behind congitive development!
Now, the burning question is - should Kerry go &ldquo;au naturelle&rdquo; prior to the birth so that the twins can smell her &ldquo;natural&rdquo; body odours ;-) maybe even ahave a curry or two?

          This installment leaves the CLI behind to show how we consume a knowledge graph within our programmatic environments. The framework I use to work with RDF is dotNetRdf.

          This installment moves beyond the simple graph model of RDF to introduce the modelling support of RDF Schema. I will go on to show you how using the W3C Standard RDFS imbues your data with another layer of meaning, and makes it easier for you to enrich your raw data with meaning over time.

          With this installment we finally get to the part of knowledge graphs that I personally find really exciting: Semantics. In this installment, I will introduce some of the simple rules of entailment that are a part of the RDFS standard.

          This is sadly not one of those blog posts where I show you what I have managed to achieve. Instead it&rsquo;s one where I ask you if you have a solution for what I am after.
When I was at university, my professor convinced me that the benefits of design by contract were worth the cost of the implementation. In every language that I have worked with ever since, I have implemented some sort of veneer over the top of the language to enable design by contract.

          I&rsquo;m on one of Juval Lowy&rsquo;s WCF Masterclass courses at the moment. Needless to say, my mind is buzzing from the fire-hose brain-dump he&rsquo;s doing on us at the moment. It&rsquo;s wonderful to see someone so deeply in command of the technology, not to mention daunting at the sheer incline of the learning curve. He&rsquo;s had some influence on the development of both C# and Visual Studio as well as WCF, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that he has sprinkled the course with some elegant little language features that joined the dots for me.

          I have been entertaining myself (not others) by writing all my technical docs in LaTeX2e lately. The problem is that there is a dearth of quality documentation on the web. I get the impression that because LaTeX2e is geared towards producing beautiful print output the people who work with it are loath to produce documentation for it that is at once compendious, and in HTML.
Come on guys! The typesetting language is IMHO unparalleled, and I absolutely love to use it.
