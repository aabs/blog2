          For years I&rsquo;ve been using a design pattern I picked up back in my Java days to help me make legacy classes more testable with Mock objects. I&rsquo;ve always had a few doubts about it, but it&rsquo;s been useful so many times that I&rsquo;ve never bothered to change it. I always keep a handy code snippet for it on my dev machines and I can knock them out in seconds. I don&rsquo;t like it because I have to create a new class factory for every type that I want to control.

          Fishdots has grown so much that it&rsquo;s taking up too much space, and shell load time is getting unweildy. So, I&rsquo;ve started a rewrite, based on the standard approach for autoloading using the plugin layout recommended by fisher plugin manager. That means a whole bunch of new repos, and probably some refactoring for fishdots.
I&rsquo;ve created a Fisher plugin template to use as the basis for each of the plugins I rewrite.

          Well, LinkMe is coming to an end. Not literally - just my involvement in it. Yes, I am off again to a new place. This time it is Readify - a smallish consultancy that specialises in emerging .NET technologies. They were recommended to me by Frank Arrigo, the group manager of the Microsoft Australian Evangelists, who rated them as an &lsquo;elite team&rsquo;. Hopefully, now I will get an opportunity to indulge my secret fetish.

          <p>We had a visitor the other night. A Ring-tailed Possum. This little fellow has
been creeping around on our roof lately. That wouldn&rsquo;t bother me too much except
for the fact that we have a tin roof, and he has sharp clicky little claws.</p>

<p>Beautiful looking creatures though. And we shall have to keep a supply of
bananas around the house. Maybe we can domesticate him&hellip;</p>

          Finding that we didn&rsquo;t have room for a drying machine, and figuring that Melbourne summers are long and hot and dry, we decided that a clothes horse or two would be a better short term investment. And, keen as she is, Kerry decided to give one a try.

Lots of baby clothes
It gives me the shivers - I see a future littered with drying stinky babies romper suits. Our neat and minimalist, and even quite stylishly modern on a good day, existence is about to become very biological.

          It&rsquo;s been a while since I last blogged. I moved to Readify, and have been burning the midnight oil ever since! But I wrote some code the other day that I thought might come in handy in future, so I thought I&rsquo;d blog it.
What I needed to do was kick off a few activities that run periodically in their own thread. As ever, I started out by writing code to manage signaling to between the main thread and the worker thread with sleep periods when there was nothing to do, till it was time to start again.
