          It says here: &ldquo;in the absence of nuclear receptor 2E1 (NR2E1), even laboratory mice can become fierce, displaying pathological violent behavior &ldquo;.
It&rsquo;s now obvious that the UK government has been manufacturing an NR2E1 suppressant for years and releasing it into the water supplies of council estates and spiking Stella Artois with it.
Do women undergo a drop in the levels of NR2E1 every month? [It&rsquo;s just a joke, alright!]

          Short Answer: Yes!
Regular readers of the The Wandering Glitch know I focused lots of attention on LINQ and the new wave of language innovation in C# 3.0. I&rsquo;m intrigued by functional programming in C#. At university, I focused on languages like C, C++, Eiffel and Ada. I&rsquo;ve never since needed to learn functional programming techniques - who uses them, after all? Functional programming had always seemed like a distant offshoot of some Bourbakiste school of mathematical programming unconcerned with practical issues of software development.

          Functional Programming - Is it worth your time? Functional Programming in C# - Higher-Order Functions  This is the second in a series on the basics of functional programming using C#. My topic today is one I touched on last time, when I described the rights and privileges of a function as a first class citizen. I&rsquo;m going to explore Higher-Order Functions this time. Higher-Order Functions are functions that themselves take or return functions.

 Donald Rumsfeld is giving the President his daily briefing. He concludes by saying: &ldquo;Yesterday, 3 Brazilian soldiers were killed.&rdquo; &ldquo;OH NO!&rdquo; the President exclaims. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo; As the President sits, head in hands, his staff quietly watch this display of emotion. Finally, the President looks up and asks, &ldquo;How many is a brazillion?&rdquo;

          This post describes generic programming and the capabilities of generics in C#. I conclude that C# Generics and C# generally are not able to solve issues that are easy in the Standard Template Library. Nothing would make me happier than if you were able to demonstrate to me that my conclusions are wrong. If thats true, please don&rsquo;t keep it to yourself!!!!!
Ever since moving to C# from C++, I&rsquo;ve missed the expressive power and elegance of the Standard Template Library (STL).

          This is me with Giganotosaurus, or as he is otherwise known &ldquo;The Great Southern Lizard&rdquo;, discovered recently in Argentina. He is a scary looking bugger. Where T-Rex would weigh in at about 6 tons of teeth and muscle, Giganotosaurus weighed at 8 tonnes. He had 15cm teeth, and was around 13 meters from the tip of his ferocious maw to the end of his whip-like tail. He could swallow grown men whole with ease, and could probably catch them even if they were in a jeep.

          [NASA Ames research centre have announced a collaboration with Google to make available the gigaquads of data that they have gathered over the years. Hopefully this should make available data from lunar expeditions and some very interesting satellite imagery. I don&rsquo;t know whether this will include data from things like the Hubble space telescope, but I hope so. One thing I am sure about, it will be a priceless resource for professional and amateur astronomers alike.
