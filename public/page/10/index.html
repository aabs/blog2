          New scientist is carrying a story about the use of cord blood in the preparation of embryonic stem cells. When K &amp; I saw references to preservation of cord blood around the hospital we thought that it was to be preserved for later use by the baby in the case of operations and anemia. Now I am wondering whether they actually want it for other people. In which case my eagerness is slightly less!

          Well, EDS seemed grim-in-the-extreme, they want someone to spend two months writing some godawful burocratic change request document for some Telstra billing department. I think that my facial expression may have hinted at the miasmic feeling of despondency and depression I felt at the prospect of having to wade neck-deep through so much pointless paper. I doubt I&rsquo;ll hear back from them, especially after asking to see one of their documents to check the level of design they wanted from me - only to discover that there was none!

          As promised last time, I have extended the query mechanism of my little application with a LINQ Query Provider. I based my initial design on the method published by Bart De Smet, but have extended that framework, cleaned it up and tied it in with the original object deserialiser for SemWeb (a semantic web library by Joshua Tauberer).
In this post I&rsquo;ll give you some edited highlights of what was involved.

          Grady Booch seems to be back into his stride after his recent illness. In his most recent blog post (Thursday, October 12, 2006) he criticises the unscrupulous advocacy of SOA as though it were a silver bullet. He also points out that any successes of SOA were more than likely due to the application of Architecture, rather than Service Orientation. He points out that SOA is a platform specific kind of message passing architecture that capitalises on the benefits of web technologies to simplify message passing on the internet.

          This from LiveScience via Kurtzweil AI: Monkeys Brains Alter to Work Robotic Arm
A new study finds a monkey&rsquo;s brain structure adapts to treat a robotic arm as if it was a natural appendage. The finding bolsters the notion that the primate brain is highly adaptable, and it adds more knowledge to the effort to create useful prosthetic devices for&hellip;
This is a very thought provoking piece of news. To me it seems to point out the way that awareness inhabits the sensorium, no matter what the origin of that sensorium.

          Here is a simple experiment that will teach you an important electrical lesson: On a cool, dry day, scuff your feet along a carpet, then reach your hand into a friend&rsquo;s mouth and touch one of his dental fillings.Â Did you notice how your friend twitched violently and cried out in pain?Â This teaches us that electricity can be a very powerful force, but we must never use it to hurt others unless we need to learn an important electrical lesson.
