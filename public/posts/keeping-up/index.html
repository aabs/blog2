<p>It&rsquo;s an unhealthy pattern, which I picked up in university – I feel guilty if I&rsquo;m not doing something useful. After I left university I tried to shed the habit, but I never seem to have done it successfully for very long. I have to <em>force</em> myself to sit in front of the box. Last century anthropologists remarked about how driven we all seem in comparison to the leisurely lifestyle of indigenous peoples. We&rsquo;ll, I wonder what they would make of a pattern like this? People feel that in order to keep up they must give up on sleep. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much room for plain old fun in this pattern eh? In Readify, they classify people in this category as <em>night-programmers</em> – and they regard them a more recruitable for obvious reasons. I can&rsquo;t help think it&rsquo;s a euphemism for <em>hopeless workaholics</em>. Not that I mind that much – I get more of a sense of achievement from an evening programming than I do from a night in front of the TV, but I still wonder.</p>
<p>I gotta do something about this. Something&rsquo;s gotta give – but what?</p>
