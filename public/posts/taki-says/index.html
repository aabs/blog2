<p>Software Engineering has much to learn from the rigours of the scientific method, and science has much to heed from the mistakes of software engineering.</p>
<p>Them thar alchemists have been at it again.I am currently scanning through a 28-page, 2353-line source code file, approximately 20 of which lines are comments (approximately 8 of which read &ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m doing!&rdquo;, 9 read &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t change this&rdquo;, and what&rsquo;s left over insists that they &ldquo;could do this better&rdquo; (I could&rsquo;ve told them that)).</p>
<p>Why do people bother lecturing and writing books on SE and OOD and the like? As soon as a thorny problem comes along, your (particularly) average software engineer will quickly revert to hacking (in the English style).</p>
