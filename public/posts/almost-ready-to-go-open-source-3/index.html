There are still quite a few things I ought to do before making any attempt to publicise it. I thought that since I&rsquo;ve been very remiss in not posting to this blog lately I could do some posting. How better than to list what I&rsquo;ve got to do before the system is unveiled to the public? I know I&rsquo;m not exactly going about this in the true open-source way, but I guess I&rsquo;m a little wary about releasing my code to the public without having crossed as many &rsquo;t&rsquo;s and dotted as many &lsquo;i&rsquo;s as I can find. I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty of improvements that people will find when I release them, but I don&rsquo;t want any of them to be dumb or outmoded errors!</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of such insecurities! Here&rsquo;s what I have to do before D-day:</p>
<ul>
<li>See if I can create a WIX installer that works. Currently I seem to be having problems with adding assemblies to the GAC. My best guess is that WIX is not able to add .NET 2.0 assemblies to the GAC because it&rsquo;s trying to use some sort of reflection on an incompatible assembly.</li>
<li>Create a user tutorial. I&rsquo;ll probably do that in this blog. It should be a pretty easy task, since I&rsquo;ve gone to great lengths to make the framework as transparent as possible.</li>
<li>Document the API using NDoc. As ever, I&rsquo;ve been slack in commenting my code. I guess I&rsquo;ll start with the main APIs and then keep at it in the months after release.</li>
<li>Run it through FxCop and make sure there are no obvious errors.</li>
<li>Run regression tests on the static code generation system! This is potentially of less value than the dynamic code generation system so I have ignored it for a while.</li>
<li>Make sure it still compiles on .NET 1.1! And how about Mono? I haven&rsquo;t seen any major commercial projects requiring Mono, but that may change&hellip;</li>
<li>Make sure that the compilation with NAnt works as well as the VS.NET 2005 beta 2 builds. Especially if WIX is not an option. I need to make tragets that will crerate binary and source distributions for release. This should then be used to upload overnight snapshots to the web each night.</li>
<li>Convert the system to work with CruiseControl.NET. I have (so far) had around 5 interviews with ThoughtWorks, so I really ought to be as obsequious as possible to boost my chances with them! ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these tasks have been performed, then I ought to post it online and start trying to publicise it a bit more.
I can then think a bit more about using the framework in earnest. I want this system because I have an object relation mapping (ORM) system that is just short of being releasable and I would like to augment it with DBC to see whether I can productise it that way. For more information on ORMs, google for Scott Ambler&rsquo;s original postings on a design for a robust persistence layer. I also want to make the second release of the framework self-hosting. That is - I want to use DBC within the DBC framework itself. How much more could I practice what I preach, eh?</p>
