<p>But, you tell me, which of the following alternatives makes more sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;newborn services department&rsquo; or &lsquo;maternity ward&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;waste transfer depot&rsquo; or &lsquo;dump&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;personalized, post-branded attentionstream&rsquo; or &lsquo;blog&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I may be revealing my Anglosaxon roots, but I think that this is another form of frenchifying words to make them seem more poncy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great for recreation, but not a good way to get my attention[stream] at least.</p>
