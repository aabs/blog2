I am fully convinced that such breakthroughs can be used to tackle the issues of world poverty, but I&rsquo;ve just finished reading <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tomorrows-War-Threat-High-Technology-Weapons/dp/0151001987">Tomorrow&rsquo;s War</a></em> by David Shukman.

<p>At this rate, the techniques and the resources for biological weapons development will be freely available, but the skills needed to combat them will not. I just think of the irresponsibility of computer hackers and virus writers - who often wreak havoc without any thought of the costs or consequences. If such power can be unleashed in the real world, then we are in way more danger than we ever were during the cold war.</p>
<p>That is a doomsday scenario, if you ask me.</p>
