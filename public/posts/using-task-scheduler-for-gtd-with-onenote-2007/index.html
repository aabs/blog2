I set up my OneNote the way that Rob from <a href="http://www.blog.7breaths.co.uk">7Breaths</a> described in his <a href="http://www.blog.7breaths.co.uk/2007/04/gtd-with-onenote-set-up.html">great blog series</a>. But I found that I still need a little prompting from time to time. So I found a neat way to shove OneNote in my face at the beginning and end of every day to &lsquo;gently&rsquo; persuade me to gather and process my tasks for the day.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got your OneNote set up according to Rob&rsquo;s method, you&rsquo;ll have a TODAY section, and in that you&rsquo;ll gather your daily notes, clippings etc for later processing and organisation. I just added a couple of pages and then I invoke them at preset times of the day. Here&rsquo;s how you do it.</p>
<p>First Create your page in the TODAY section. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you call it. I called mine the &ldquo;<em>Brain Dump Area</em>&quot;:</p>
<p><a href="%7Bstatic%7D2008/02/image.png"><img src="%7Bstatic%7D2008/02/image-thumb.png" alt="image">{width=&ldquo;570&rdquo; height=&ldquo;414&rdquo;}</a></p>
<p>See what I mean about gentle? Next I create a scheduled task using the (for Vista) Task Scheduler. You&rsquo;ll find this in your admin tools menu off the start menu:</p>
<p><a href="%7Bstatic%7D2008/02/image1.png"><img src="%7Bstatic%7D2008/02/image-thumb1.png" alt="image">{width=&ldquo;426&rdquo; height=&ldquo;128&rdquo;}</a></p>
<p>in the task pane, select &ldquo;Create Basic Task&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="%7Bstatic%7D2008/02/image2.png"><img src="%7Bstatic%7D2008/02/image-thumb2.png" alt="image">{width=&ldquo;272&rdquo; height=&ldquo;197&rdquo;}</a></p>
<p>Give it a name</p>
<p><a href="%7Bstatic%7D2008/02/image3.png"><img src="%7Bstatic%7D2008/02/image-thumb3.png" alt="image">{width=&ldquo;714&rdquo; height=&ldquo;496&rdquo;}</a></p>
<p>Select a daily task, run on whatever schedule you like, then click through to actions, and select the &ldquo;Start a Program&rdquo; option</p>
<p><a href="%7Bstatic%7D2008/02/image4.png"><img src="%7Bstatic%7D2008/02/image-thumb4.png" alt="image">{width=&ldquo;334&rdquo; height=&ldquo;92&rdquo;}</a></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be presented with an option to enter the program location, some command line arguments and an optional area to select where the program gets run. Locate your instance of OneNote (mine&rsquo;s at &ldquo;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\ONENOTE.EXE&rdquo;) and enter its path in the program area. Then go to OneNote and navigate to the page you created, and right click on the page tab. Select the &ldquo;Copy Hyperlink to this Page&rdquo; option, and then go back to Task Scheduler.</p>
<p><a href="%7Bstatic%7D2008/02/image5.png"><img src="%7Bstatic%7D2008/02/image-thumb5.png" alt="image">{width=&ldquo;296&rdquo; height=&ldquo;230&rdquo;}</a></p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Add Arguments (optional):&rdquo; text box enter: <strong>/hyperlink &ldquo;&quot;</strong> and between the quotes paste the hyperlink from the page you created in OneNote. Mine looked like this:</p>
<p><strong>/hyperlink &ldquo;onenote://C:/Users/Andrew%20Matthews/Documents/OneNote%20Notebooks/GettingThingsDone/
TODAY.one#Brain%20Dump%20Area&amp;section-id={DD18A524-CB73-47D9-A152-778C2116DA01}&amp;
page-id={0F370401-83D6-4BB3-B2CC-7266A16395B7}&amp;end&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Yours will be different, but similar. Click through to the finish button, and you&rsquo;re done. If you right click on the task entry and select Run, you can see what it will do. It starts OneNote selecting the Brain Dump Page for immediate display.</p>
<p>Now all I have to do is resist the urge to hit Snooze, and I&rsquo;ll be really organised.</p>
