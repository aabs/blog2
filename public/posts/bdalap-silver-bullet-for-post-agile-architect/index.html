The methodological guru said &ldquo;<em>BDALAP recognises that certain design decisions are a) complex and b) have far reaching implications</em>&rdquo;. The solution, he says, is to perform Big Design As Late As Possible.</p>
<p>Of course, an Agile exponent would say that &ldquo;<em>as late as possible</em>&rdquo; would be when the application proves not to scale. A waterfall exponent would disagree, saying that &ldquo;<em>as late as possible</em>&rdquo; is before anyone even thought of the project.</p>
<p>I applaud the triumph of common sense that tries to place Design somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Alec - can I sign up to become the first (or is that second?) antipodean &ldquo;BDALAP Master&rdquo;?</p>
