<p>Søren was not happy with the format of errors being reported, nor the potential for massive serialisation blowout. Rather than comment on the blog, he went away and did something about it. And it&rsquo;s pretty good! Go <a href="http://skarpt.dk/blog/?p=14">take a look</a>, and then pick up the baton from him. Your challenge is to extract the parmeter objects from the expression trees of the predicates and take lightweight snapshots of the objects refered to. You also need a &ldquo;platform independent&rdquo; way to serialize objects for this scheme (i.e. one that doesn&rsquo;t depend on XmlSerialisation or WCF data contracts.</p>
<p>Think you can do it? Apply here! :P</p>
