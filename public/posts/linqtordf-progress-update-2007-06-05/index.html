It&rsquo;s amazing what a difference a full day can make to your progress, compared to trying to get as much done as I can when I&rsquo;m on the train.</p>
<p>Last week when I blogged, I had the rough outlines of a SPARQL query, but it was missing quite a bit. There were also a few bits that were just plain wrong, such as commas separating SELECT parameters. That&rsquo;s been corrected now. The properties in the GraphPattern are also restricted to those that are mentioned in the FILTER clause, or the projection.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also added support for the OrderBy, Take and Skip operators, which correspond to the &ldquo;ORDER BY&rdquo;, &ldquo;LIMIT&rdquo; and &ldquo;OFFSET&rdquo; clauses in SPARQL. The unit test I&rsquo;m working with is looking pretty overweight now:</p>
<pre><code>[TestMethod]
public void SparqlQueryWithTheLot()
{
    string urlToRemoteSparqlEndpoint = @&quot;http://someUri&quot;;
    TripleStore ts = new TripleStore();
    ts.EndpointUri = urlToRemoteSparqlEndpoint;
    ts.QueryType = QueryType.RemoteSparqlStore;
    IRdfQuery&lt;Track&gt; qry = new RDF(ts).ForType&lt;Track&gt;();
    var q = (from t in qry
        where t.Year == 2006 &amp;&amp;
        t.GenreName == &quot;History 5 | Fall 2006 | UC Berkeley&quot;
        orderby t.FileLocation
        select new {t.Title, t.FileLocation}).Skip(10).Take(5);
    foreach(var track in q){
        Trace.WriteLine(track.Title + &quot;: &quot; + track.FileLocation);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://11011.net/software/vspaste"></a></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a sample of the query string that gets produced for it:</p>
<pre><code>@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .
@prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt; .
@prefix xsdt: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt; .
@prefix fn: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions#&gt;  .
@prefix a: &lt;http://aabs.purl.org/ontologies/2007/04/music#&gt; .

SELECT ?FileLocation ?Title
WHERE {
?t a:year ?Year .
?t a:genreName ?GenreName .
?t a:fileLocation ?FileLocation .
?t a:title ?Title .
FILTER {
((?Year)=(2006^^xsdt:int))&amp;&amp;((?GenreName)=(&quot;History 5 | Fall 2006 | UC Berkeley&quot;^^xsdt:string))
}
}
ORDER BY ?FileLocation
LIMIT 5
OFFSET 10
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://11011.net/software/vspaste"></a><a href="http://11011.net/software/vspaste"></a>Which is almost exactly what we want. I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;s about time to set up some kind of SPARQL server to test the queries for real. We also have to check whether the ObjectDeserialisationSink is capable of deserialising results from a SPARQL query as well as an RSQuary query.</p>
