<p>&hellip;diddle diddle dum. diddle diddle dum. And we arrive at the present moment. Yes I sat there like a zombie for a whole evening. But the end result is what counts and that&rsquo;s the problem. Now all of my code doesn&rsquo;t work any more. Boo Hoo.</p>
<p>So, I have to either debug the EDRA config app block, or go hunting for a .NET 2.0 version of a config tool. I probably also have to do the same with all the templating tools, logging tools, and every other trace of code reuse that I have incorporated into my Dbc system.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly - VS.NET 2005 beta 2 is by a long margin the slickest development environment that I have ever seen. But I really can&rsquo;t be bothered to go through all this pain at the moment. Perhaps I should revisit the idea of using VPC 2004 for my dev environment. Problem is that there is a whole other bunch of problems associated with that route. So what do I do? I wanna be able to play with the latest toys. But I wanna do it without having to incur weeks of pointless twiddling after I realize my recklessness has rendered weeks of work either obsolete or too bleeding-edge to work. [sob]</p>
