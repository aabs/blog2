<p>This reminds me so much of Ben Bova&rsquo;s <em>Uplift War,</em> that it&rsquo;s funny. I don&rsquo;t think its an inherently evil idea, unlike those who believe that the word &lsquo;natural&rsquo; should be in capitals. I do think that this is a plagiarised idea - I&rsquo;m not sure if it was Bova&rsquo;s idea in the first place. If not him then who?</p>
<p>I would have thought that before people performed frivolous augmentation research (adding night-vision goggles to squirrels for gods sake), they might look to genetics to perform some fundamental enhancements to the cognitive capabilities of an animal.</p>
<p>They might also want to think about performing some serious research into growing two dicks on a tiger, so i don&rsquo;t have to have so many migraines.</p>
