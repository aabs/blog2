<p>And there&rsquo;s another thing - what is different about the blood flowing through the cord anyway? I thought that a baby&rsquo;s immune system was suppressed during gestation and for a while after (while breast-feeding?) and that that was necessary since the baby was receiving umbilical infusions of its mother&rsquo;s blood (and antibodies etc). Is the blood different in the placenta? Is the placenta maintaining its own blood supply that is cut off from that of the mother? How does it get oxygenated?</p>
<p>So many questions.</p>
