          It&rsquo;s taken a long time, and nearly 300 blog posts (and probably a cross link or two from Mitch whose site stats make me very envious) But &ldquo;The Wandering Glitch&rdquo; has finally made its way to the first page of Google results for searches on &ldquo;Andrew Matthews&rdquo; which considering how common the name is made me very happy. I sit behind my namesake, who is the artist and author of the excellent book &ldquo;Being Happy&rdquo;.

          *The wombat lives across the seas, Among the far Antipodes. He may exist on nuts and berries, Or then again, on missionaries; His distant habitat precludes Conclusive knowledge of his moods. But I would not engage the wombat In any form of mortal combat. &ndash; &ldquo;The Wombat&rdquo; *
I saw something streak past my driveway the other night. It ran in a manner not unlike a chimp, or baboon - on all fours with a two-by-two gait.

          I received a very heart-rending letter today from a lady whose email is helenamed@i12.com (yes spiders, please use it) who needs my help. As a renowned Charitable Organisation I am now the first port of call for all such desperate people who, ridden with cancer and sadly widowed from a rich, industrious and virtuous husbands, need to transfer money out of accounts that work in very strange ways. I am ever glad to be of assistance to the rich and needy worldwide, and to do that I still need your donations readers.

          Well, Aabs Dbc is now out there in the public domain now. Yayyy!!!!!
I&rsquo;ve created an open-source project on sourceforge, and advertised there for help with documentation, installers and general app developers. I&rsquo;ve uploaded an initial source code release - and configured my paypal settings.
I can&rsquo;t wait to see how it is received by the public. Pay the site a visit, and let me know what YOU think. And, of course, if you want to make a donation&hellip; ;o)

          It seems I touched a bit of a raw nerve with Alec when I pointed out that some IDEs are less crap than others. Specifically, I was referring to the ones that have major corporate clout invested in their production. He pointed out that they require standardisation of tools within a development team as well as standardisation of APIs, SCM tools, documentation, and build tools. He also points out that they obscure information from the developer that is necessary for the proper understanding of a complex system.

          I recently ran into this problem with one of our clients. It&rsquo;s the sort of thing that I take ages to track down a solution to, and then once I have solved it, I immediately forget what the solution is. So I&rsquo;m putting it here as an aid memoire.
The client had a module that they were using to create a custom Principal object derived from a FormsPrincipal. I found that after I had converted the project to work with VS.

          It sounds like Daniel Tammet is anything but an idiot, but he is definitely an autistic savant. His insight into his abilities are described in this fascinating article in the Guardian.
Daniel&rsquo;s facility with languages and figures reminds me of a man called Shiva who I met in Goa last year. Shiva is not not in any way mentally disabled, but he is fluent in 15 languages (last time I asked - probably more now).

          The graph below I found from a recruitment site. It lists the relative importance of programming language skills and how they have changed over the last few years.
Aside from the fact that C# isn&rsquo;t even in there, which I find a little alarming, it shows that all of the languages listed are in decline. Especially my beloved C++, king of all languages. Does this graph indicate that there is a proliferation of languages and that the impact of previously major languages is being diluted.

          What is the ideal of good design?
There are limitless answers to this question. Most of them focus on the day to day business of writing software – and aim to minimize the effects of bad design choices through application of a simple principle. The patchwork of these principles when applied in a harmonious way is hoped to give health and vigour to a system. When you write software, you generally hope to extend its lifespan beyond the short term - to help it become a living thing.
