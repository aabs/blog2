      Joe Duffy is busy at work writing a book about concurrency in .NET. He asks how we would spend our $100, given a choice from a set of topics available. Well, I&rsquo;d have to spend mine like this:
$5 - (0) Parallel algorithms (Comp Sci., technology agnostic) $5 - (1) Architecting large scale concurrent programs $5 - (2) Windows concurrency internals $5 - (3) CLR concurrency internals $5 - (4) Windows (Win32) concurrency API best practices $5 - (5) CLR concurrency API best practices $5 - (6) Client-side concurrency $5 - (7) Server-side concurrency $5 - (8) Reusable concurrency primitives (building and using them) $5 - (9) Performance and scalability $50 - (A) Debugging

      I have been receiving increasingly desperate messages from various scions of once elevated families of the Ivory Coast, Kenya and South Africa. They have all these funds tied up and the need ME to help them release it (in confidence of course, but I know you, dear reader, will not tell a soul)!
I feel honoured to be considered for the noble task of helping these courteous young people out of their dire circumstances.

      It&rsquo;s been five days already, and the urge has come upon me to write a blog entry to say what&rsquo;s been going on.
Friday afternoon I got a call from Kerry saying that she&rsquo;d had a &lsquo;show&rsquo;. Naturally I wondered whether it was a cabaret or the normal sort. It turned out to be a whole lot more biological than that, involving mucus plugs and contractions and Emily&rsquo;s feet slipping down into the birth canal.

      A new &lsquo;chutist had just jumped from the plane at 10,000 feet, and soon discovered that all his lines were hopelessly tangled. At about 5,000 feet, still struggling, he noticed someone coming up from the ground at about the same speed as he was going towards the ground. As they passed each other at 3,000 feet, the &lsquo;chutist yells, &ldquo;HEY! DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PARACHUTES?&rdquo; The reply came, fading towards the end, &ldquo;NO!

      Today I had record stats on my blog. I passed the 200 hits per day threshold.

Since Mitch Denny told me the kind of visitor numbers he got on his blog, I&rsquo;ve been operating with a bit of an inferiority complex. At the time I was peaking at about 20 hits per day and at the time I was pleased with those levels. Since then (about 4 months ago) I have been trying to attract more visitors to the blog.

It is a &lsquo;Ultra-High Molecular Weight Low Temperature Thermoplastic ' which is to say - a form of modelling plastic that can be made plyable at just above room temperature, and can be moulded to almost any shape, but which when it cools is hard as steel. Now I have my shed, (well I share it with Cockroaches and Huntsmen spiders and moths the size of mice, but I call it mine) and a double garage (not pronounced like Mirage but like Forage) I also have the opportunity (but not the leasure time) to get more &lsquo;practical&rsquo;.
