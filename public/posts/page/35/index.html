      In almost every version 1.0 system I design, I end up endlessly rehearsing the pros and cons of different implementations of the domain model (or lack of it). It&rsquo;s getting so tedious that I recently decided to answer the question to my own satisfaction. I produced a spreadsheet with as many design factors that I could think of and the different models that I have worked with or considered over the years.

      I recently got this excellent comment from Jeff Grigg on my domain model debate article. I started to reply with a comment, but the reply got to the point where it became a bit of a blog post in its own right, so I thought it worth giving it first class status. Jeff wrote this:
 Interesting concept: I particularly like the concept of using numeric weights and rankings, rather than just claims of preference.

      Several years ago, I worked on a contract in Central London (That&rsquo;s in Great Britain, an island off the coast of America) and I used to commute to work by train (that&rsquo;s a bit like a long chauffeur-driven car on rails). Every few weeks or so, people used to commit suicide by hurling themselves under the trains. Generally, these terminal events took place in or around the Crawley or Hayward&rsquo;s Heath areas.

      I did a quick search on the new Google trends service, for the word &lsquo;algorithm&rsquo;.
The top 6 cities out of the top 10, were in india.
Perhaps I should move to India. they get to use algorithms there!
Either way, it seems that that would be a fair indicator of the fact that western developers are writing less low level code than the indians? Either that or the india programmers need to refer to the web for help more often.

      The executive summary is that we will have computing capacity to handle whole brain simulations by around 2020, and that Moores law applies to functional brain mapping as well as to processors.
 &ldquo;I figure we need about 10 quadrillion calculations a second to provide a functional equivalent to all the regions of the brain. IBM&rsquo;s Blue Gene/L computer is already at 100 trillion. If we plug in the semiconductor industry&rsquo;s projections, we can see that 10 quadrillion calculations a second will be available for $1,000 by around 2020.

I must admit that it&rsquo;s a pleasant change to go to one of these things and have a good time, especially since for years I have adopted the &ldquo;forge no ties&rdquo; policy to my clients.

      One in 20 of UK internet users say they have lost money through online scams, a poll for service provider AOL finds.
These people are those on the very far left of the bell curve. Here&rsquo;s an interesting calculation. How many people in the world have access to email? I don&rsquo;t know, but lets assume about 1B. 1 in twenty of those represents a figure of 20M. If I could get a dollar from each of these people, I would be rich indeed.

      I recently attended Juval Lowy&rsquo;s WCF Master class course in Sydney, and in the introduction to the course Juval made some really interesting observations about the origins and justifications of Service Oriented Architecture. I was reading over the notes I took the other day, and I thought they were worthy of a blog post. Thanks go to Juval for making the course entertaining with so many quotable observations. I&rsquo;ve tried to relay them here as he said them.
