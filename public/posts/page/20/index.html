 Eradicate typographical errors from the development process. Remove source code from the development process. Move the emphasis of the development process from coding to design. Make the development process a visual rather than linguistic one. Move maintenance from code to design. Make debugging easy Make designs directly executable Make viewing levels of abstraction easy. Make moving from one level of abstraction to aqnother easy.

      Wow.
I have never seen anybody do such unnatural things with a guitar. I mean he was fiddling with it in ways that seemed bound to produce an awful cacophony, but somehow in his hands, the guitar produced a gorgeous sweet complex sound, that complemented the rest of the band perfectly. Wow.
I have to say, though, that if we were playing Star Qualities, he would definitely be &ldquo;50% Vin Diesel, 50% Gerard O&rsquo;Donnell&rdquo; For those of you in the know, that is a pretty weird combination.

      Security vendor VeriSign found 66 percent would choose to give up their passwords for a Starbucks coffee, during an informal on-the-street survey conducted Thursday in San Francisco.
I&rsquo;m speechless!!! Not about the fact that people would give up their passwords for a cup of coffee. But that they thought that starbucks coffee was worth the price of a password. I mean, have you tasted that slop? It&rsquo;s the weakest, palest most bland coffee in the world (generally about as interesting as VeriSign&rsquo;s line of business).

Despite having used a laptop at work for years, I&rsquo;ve always kept a paper notebook by my side. I depend on these notebooks. I even purchased the whole UK supply of Paperchase&rsquo;s 500 page, leatherette, squared, rounded notebooks. These beauties are un-dog-ear-able, perfect for UML diagrams, lightweights and relatively inexpensive. The supply in the UK was dwindling when I discovered them in Cambridge. Apparently the Japanese manufactured them, and the Americans were buying whatever stocks were left.

      [digg=http://www.digg.com/tech_news/Keeping_up_2]It used to be that you could keep abreast with the news by reading the Sunday morning newspapers, or at least that&rsquo;s how it seemed. Now I find that I scan several hundred RSS feeds to track all the news I care about. The birth of the Blogosphere is a mixed blessing to anyone with a life. You have to fit your surfing and professional development in around everything else. According to Google&rsquo;s analysis of my reading patterns, I seem to be doing most of that after dark:

I took this photo a few weeks ago. Kerry still keeps on growing. She&rsquo;s already bigger than some of her friends when they were at full term. It&rsquo;s getting a bit uncomfortable for her now. I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time giving her foot rubs now! Not that I mind - she has perfect feet, or at least that&rsquo;s what she keeps telling me.

OK. no it wasn&rsquo;t, but I bet Kerry never thought, when she posed for this, that one day she would come to think of this shape as normal!

      The smell of mother helps in the growth and development of a newborn child&rsquo;s olfactory centres. This is used in the process of bonding and is closely related to the way that the rest of the brain wires itself up to perceive the rest of the world. Just as I&rsquo;ve been saying for years - reality itself is the force behind congitive development!
Now, the burning question is - should Kerry go &ldquo;au naturelle&rdquo; prior to the birth so that the twins can smell her &ldquo;natural&rdquo; body odours ;-) maybe even ahave a curry or two?

      This is the first in a short series introducing Knowledge Graphs. It covers just the basics, showing how to write, store, query and work with graph data using RDF (short for Resource Description Format). I will keep it free of theory and interesting but unnecessary digressions. Let me know in the comments if you find it useful, and also tell me what other Knowledge Graph topics you would like to know more about.
