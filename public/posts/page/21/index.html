    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      This installment moves beyond the simple graph model of RDF to introduce the modelling support of RDF Schema. I will go on to show you how using the W3C Standard RDFS imbues your data with another layer of meaning, and makes it easier for you to enrich your raw data with meaning over time.
This is part 5 of an ongoing series providing a little background on ‘knowledge graphs‘. The aim is to let software developers get up to speed as fast as possible.

      This is sadly not one of those blog posts where I show you what I have managed to achieve. Instead it&rsquo;s one where I ask you if you have a solution for what I am after.
When I was at university, my professor convinced me that the benefits of design by contract were worth the cost of the implementation. In every language that I have worked with ever since, I have implemented some sort of veneer over the top of the language to enable design by contract.

      I&rsquo;m on one of Juval Lowy&rsquo;s WCF Masterclass courses at the moment. Needless to say, my mind is buzzing from the fire-hose brain-dump he&rsquo;s doing on us at the moment. It&rsquo;s wonderful to see someone so deeply in command of the technology, not to mention daunting at the sheer incline of the learning curve. He&rsquo;s had some influence on the development of both C# and Visual Studio as well as WCF, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that he has sprinkled the course with some elegant little language features that joined the dots for me.

      I have been entertaining myself (not others) by writing all my technical docs in LaTeX2e lately. The problem is that there is a dearth of quality documentation on the web. I get the impression that because LaTeX2e is geared towards producing beautiful print output the people who work with it are loath to produce documentation for it that is at once compendious, and in HTML.
Come on guys! The typesetting language is IMHO unparalleled, and I absolutely love to use it.

      Forgive the recent silence - I&rsquo;ve been in my shed.
Frequently, I need some variation on the Visitor or HierarchicalVisitor patterns to analyse or transform an object graph. Recent work on a query builder for an old-skool query API sent my thoughts once again to the Visitor pattern. I normally hand roll these frameworks based on my experiences with recursive descent compilers, but this time I thought I&rsquo;d produce a more GoF-compliant implementation.

      Alec has provided a few of the reasons he hates Microsoft. They all seem like sentimental attachment to other peoples litigation defeats… In honour of that, I have changed the colour of my blog for a day or two&hellip;
I too went through an undergraduate phase of anti-MS zealotry, and adopted obscure platforms as a kind of protest (i.e. Linux, Java, etc) then I went out to work, and realized that as far as the relevance of my skills is concerned, it didn&rsquo;t matter whether the standards I knew were de jure or de facto, just so long as they were standard.

      Imagine a secure way to host Docker containers with functions (like Amazon Lambda) on the Golem compute platform, combined with Lightning Network, a massively scalable payment platform fast enough to support pay per use billing.
That would be a VERY different kind of deployment and orchestration model. Perhaps you might submit a Kubernetes/Docker Swarm YAML file and a secure data source, and dynamically direct hosting to the lowest bidder.
What would security have to look like for this idea to work?

      Derek&rsquo;s kittens are displaying behaviour that seems to be hard wired. There is a huge range of examples of linguistic capabilities seeming to follow a strict developmental schedule &ndash; use of verbs, tenses or telegraphic speach all arrive at about the same age in children. Chomsky is the most famous linguist to claim that language, or core parts of it, are inate. His justification was that there appears to be a poverty of input in a child&rsquo;s linguistic environment.
