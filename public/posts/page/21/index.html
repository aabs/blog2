          [digg=http://www.digg.com/tech_news/Keeping_up_2]It used to be that you could keep abreast with the news by reading the Sunday morning newspapers, or at least that&rsquo;s how it seemed. Now I find that I scan several hundred RSS feeds to track all the news I care about. The birth of the Blogosphere is a mixed blessing to anyone with a life. You have to fit your surfing and professional development in around everything else. According to Google&rsquo;s analysis of my reading patterns, I seem to be doing most of that after dark:

          kerry at 24 weeks Originally uploaded by Andrew Matthews.
I took this photo a few weeks ago. Kerry still keeps on growing. She&rsquo;s already bigger than some of her friends when they were at full term. It&rsquo;s getting a bit uncomfortable for her now. I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time giving her foot rubs now! Not that I mind - she has perfect feet, or at least that&rsquo;s what she keeps telling me.

<p>Ha Ha Surprise
It was all just a drunken stunt!</p>
<p>OK. no it wasn&rsquo;t, but I bet Kerry never thought, when she posed for this, that one day she would come to think of this shape as normal!</p>

<p>Support her - she&rsquo;s not just a mum, you know, she&rsquo;s a <em>blogwife</em>! Besides, when you&rsquo;re as big as she is, you can&rsquo;t divert yourself with gymnastics&hellip;</p>

          The smell of mother helps in the growth and development of a newborn child&rsquo;s olfactory centres. This is used in the process of bonding and is closely related to the way that the rest of the brain wires itself up to perceive the rest of the world. Just as I&rsquo;ve been saying for years - reality itself is the force behind congitive development!
Now, the burning question is - should Kerry go &ldquo;au naturelle&rdquo; prior to the birth so that the twins can smell her &ldquo;natural&rdquo; body odours ;-) maybe even ahave a curry or two?

          This is sadly not one of those blog posts where I show you what I have managed to achieve. Instead it&rsquo;s one where I ask you if you have a solution for what I am after.
When I was at university, my professor convinced me that the benefits of design by contract were worth the cost of the implementation. In every language that I have worked with ever since, I have implemented some sort of veneer over the top of the language to enable design by contract.

          I&rsquo;m on one of Juval Lowy&rsquo;s WCF Masterclass courses at the moment. Needless to say, my mind is buzzing from the fire-hose brain-dump he&rsquo;s doing on us at the moment. It&rsquo;s wonderful to see someone so deeply in command of the technology, not to mention daunting at the sheer incline of the learning curve. He&rsquo;s had some influence on the development of both C# and Visual Studio as well as WCF, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that he has sprinkled the course with some elegant little language features that joined the dots for me.

          I have been entertaining myself (not others) by writing all my technical docs in LaTeX2e lately. The problem is that there is a dearth of quality documentation on the web. I get the impression that because LaTeX2e is geared towards producing beautiful print output the people who work with it are loath to produce documentation for it that is at once compendious, and in HTML.
Come on guys! The typesetting language is IMHO unparalleled, and I absolutely love to use it.

          Forgive the recent silence - I&rsquo;ve been in my shed.
Frequently, I need some variation on the Visitor or HierarchicalVisitor patterns to analyse or transform an object graph. Recent work on a query builder for an old-skool query API sent my thoughts once again to the Visitor pattern. I normally hand roll these frameworks based on my experiences with recursive descent compilers, but this time I thought I&rsquo;d produce a more GoF-compliant implementation.

          Alec has provided a few of the reasons he hates Microsoft. They all seem like sentimental attachment to other peoples litigation defeats… In honour of that, I have changed the colour of my blog for a day or two&hellip;
I too went through an undergraduate phase of anti-MS zealotry, and adopted obscure platforms as a kind of protest (i.e. Linux, Java, etc) then I went out to work, and realized that as far as the relevance of my skills is concerned, it didn&rsquo;t matter whether the standards I knew were de jure or de facto, just so long as they were standard.
