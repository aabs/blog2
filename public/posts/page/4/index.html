          My data recovery program has started to recover files. Can you believe it? It took two whole weeks for R-Studio to index the contents of my MP3 drive. This 200GB drive got nadgered by a nice combination of travelling to work on my back every day and being used in combination with Windows XP Pro SP2 and hibernation. Just as well I didn&rsquo;t keep anything on there that was of immediate importance&hellip;

          Alec, a man of great perspicacity, and wisdom, has granted us another Agile pearl of wisdom. All of which is totally correct. There&rsquo;s no doubt that if you are with The Complicators, then you can screw up a product no matter what method you follow.
Let&rsquo;s just try a thought experiment though – Imagine you&rsquo;d been disciplined and hadn&rsquo;t thought of the future at all, and you&rsquo;d designed your system solely to work on RJE 2780.

          Alfred Thompson recently blogged about an interesting interview given by Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of C++, now professor of computer science at Texas A&amp;M University. As ever the interviewers were after his prescription for the Silver Bullet that will save us all from ourselves. Alfred has already boiled down the interview to a couple of interesting sound bites, and I aim to do the same to his post. The quote that particularly caught my attention was Stroustrup&rsquo;s comment on the &lsquo;pragmatic&rsquo; way in which modern software gets developed.

          I have been tweeking and fiddling with the framework in readiness for making it open source. There are still quite a few things I ought to do before making any attempt to publicise it. I thought that since I&rsquo;ve been very remiss in not posting to this blog lately I could do some posting. How better than to list what I&rsquo;ve got to do before the system is unveiled to the public?

          <p>Here&rsquo;s some, slightly more accessible, pictures of Mum and Dad&rsquo;s new conservatoire. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll all agree that it&rsquo;s very small, I&rsquo;m mean - Is that a conservatoire for ants?</p>

          As you will recall from the previous post, I have been wondering about how to implement the functionality for dynamic proxies. Well I saw this great article, by Viji Sarathy, on the web, and think that this might be the way to go.
It uses Context Bound Objects to ensure the interception of all calls by the CLR without any explicit framework setup by the user. We can guarantee that the contracts get followed, whether the user tries to evade them or not.

          I&rsquo;ll be doing a short introduction on LINQ tonight at the Dev SIG of Victoria.NET in Collins Street. I only have 20 minutes to talk so I won&rsquo;t be able to go into too much depth. What I do hope to do is persuade the audience that LINQ is worthy of their attention. If I can persuade a few people to go out and develop their own query providers, then even better.

          Normally I have a very optimistic outlook. Especially when it comes to technological breakthroughs. But this morning I was given pause for thought. MAKE magazine carried a news article today about a highly accurate DNA replicator for $10. I am fully convinced that such breakthroughs can be used to tackle the issues of world poverty, but I&rsquo;ve just finished reading Tomorrow&rsquo;s War by David Shukman. It was written over 10 years ago but was gloomy, even then about our chances of controlling the proliferation of expertise in the production of WMD, and it was written before 9/11.

          Dom suggested that &ldquo;The distance to our goals always seems further to those realists without sufficient knowledge.&rdquo;. My personal experience in software indicates that when you are attempting to solve a difficult problem with many unknowns, you cannot predict the degree of complexity of the problem or solution without actually solving the problem. Good estimation in a software project is an exercise in pessimism. I also find that my pessimism is never enough!
