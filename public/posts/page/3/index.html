          Well, LinkMe is coming to an end. Not literally - just my involvement in it. Yes, I am off again to a new place. This time it is Readify - a smallish consultancy that specialises in emerging .NET technologies. They were recommended to me by Frank Arrigo, the group manager of the Microsoft Australian Evangelists, who rated them as an &rsquo;elite team&rsquo;. Hopefully, now I will get an opportunity to indulge my secret fetish.

          <p>We had a visitor the other night. A Ring-tailed Possum. This little fellow has
been creeping around on our roof lately. That wouldn&rsquo;t bother me too much except
for the fact that we have a tin roof, and he has sharp clicky little claws.</p>

<p>Beautiful looking creatures though. And we shall have to keep a supply of
bananas around the house. Maybe we can domesticate him&hellip;</p>

          I got the following in an email disclaimer that foreshadows interesting times ahead:

Sounds like humans are only part of the game these days, and &ldquo;entities&rdquo; will be asserting their rights more forcefully in future. Perhaps such entities represent affiliated groups of humans, but perhaps they represent other semi-sentient information agregates such as software agents or epi-phenomena growing out there on the web as viruses or telephone exchanges?

          Finding that we didn&rsquo;t have room for a drying machine, and figuring that Melbourne summers are long and hot and dry, we decided that a clothes horse or two would be a better short term investment. And, keen as she is, Kerry decided to give one a try.
Lots of baby clothes
It gives me the shivers - I see a future littered with drying stinky babies romper suits. Our neat and minimalist, and even quite stylishly modern on a good day, existence is about to become very biological.

          It&rsquo;s been a while since I last blogged. I moved to Readify, and have been burning the midnight oil ever since! But I wrote some code the other day that I thought might come in handy in future, so I thought I&rsquo;d blog it.
What I needed to do was kick off a few activities that run periodically in their own thread. As ever, I started out by writing code to manage signaling to between the main thread and the worker thread with sleep periods when there was nothing to do, till it was time to start again.

          [digg=http://www.digg.com/programming/A_simple_semantic_web_application_in_C]The latest update of the SemWeb library from Josh Tauberer includes a C# implementation of the Euler reasoner. This reasoner is able to go beyond simplistic RDFS reasoning â€“ being able to navigate the class and property relationships - to make use of rules. The ontology I&rsquo;ve been using to get used to coding in the framework models a simple state machine. The ontology couldn&rsquo;t be simpler. Here&rsquo;s an N3 file that declares the classes and their relationships.

          About 6 years ago I read a book by Edward de Bono, called modestly the de Bono Code Book. His idea was to devise a representation for thoughts and statements that went beyond the simple propositions from predicate logic. Initially, I was intrigued by the idea that I could learn to represent ideas in a way that was both terse, unambiguous and that enhanced my abilities to reason on paper. I quickly became disillusioned by the notation because it was both arbitrary and incomprehensible; there was no obvious way (as far as I could make out) for representing an arbitrary thought.

          Migraine patients who received true acupuncture had no decrease in headaches as compared with those who received sham acupuncture treatment, according to a study in the May 4 issue of JAMA.
It surprises me that this has not been identified before. Yet another example of the healing power of the mind. It&rsquo;s currently fashionable to criticise western medicine in favour of esoteric chinese medicine, so I wonder how long before the report is accused of rationalist, reductionist bias (As though that were a bad thing).

          Tony says he&rsquo;s had a hard time persuading Portals to &lsquo;get&rsquo; the advantages of Web2.0. I guess the portals would get Web2.0 from a usability perspective. It makes sense for them not to divert a little effort to it - most of Web2.0 can be built for very little cost on top of existing functionality (it&rsquo;s not rocket science after all!) But then - some of them have been around long enough to want to try to fall into the &lsquo;bank&rsquo; category - i.
