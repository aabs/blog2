This was my first outing with the Pentax K-x that I got recently. In these pictures, I&rsquo;m trying to get to grips with the camera, so I didn&rsquo;t have any particular objective other than to take pictures.
The light was so harsh it was very difficult for me to gauge whether the exposures were working - I couldn&rsquo;t see the live views or previews at all!

      Eric Gunnerson, has a very true post about how many of those who manage or participate in software development have caught the &lsquo;lets post-modernise our language to pretend we&rsquo;re innovating, rather then give an extra effort to clarify our thinking&rsquo; bug. Lately, I have been bending poor Kerry&rsquo;s ear about this to the extent that I am now categorised as a grumpy old man. Not that I care what the world thinks, but I think that language has more value if it is clear.

      But I was just testing whether Word 2007 is actually able to initiate the upload of a new blog post. It seems to me that it might be able to refresh an existing blog entry on wordpress, but beyond that it reports false positives. Of course, if you read this post, then you can disregard all of the above as blatant slander.
Update: yes, word posts OK to Wordpress, but it uses the default value for DateTime jan 1st 1970.

      Are you kidding me? tectonic causes for south american earthquakes was a total sham! Think about it! Everyone knows that there&rsquo;s a war on. And have you noticed that the CIA has started to act very strangely? They obviously don’t want this story getting out. I mean, what would happen if people began asking Why are they all near the USA? Well, they may be able to fool the sheeple, but the members of the USGS aren&rsquo;t swallowing their story.

The Semantic Web, a knowledge-centric model for the Web&rsquo;s future, supplements human-readable documents and XML message formats with data that can be understood and processed by machines. SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) is to the semantic Web as SQL is to a relational database. It allows applications to make sophisticated queries against distributed RDF databases, and is widely supported by many competing frameworks. This tutorial demonstrates its use through the example of a team tracking and journaling system for a virtual company.

      Today I got my first experience of being caught in a storm of golf ball sized hailstones. We&rsquo;d decided to take the day out and visit the Moomba Festival in the city centre. All was well, and the kids were in a cub scouts arena trying their hands at rock climbing. Suddenly, we heard an ominous rumbling and within seconds we were pelted with inch thick hailstones.
We quickly caught the kids as they fell off the climbing wall, and nobly covered them with our bodies as we hurried them into the canvas awnings that the scoutleaders had erected earlier in the day.

      Recently, Søren Skovsbøll wrote a excellent follow up to a little post I did a while back on using C# 3.0 expression trees for representing predicates in design by contract. The conclusion of that series was that C# was inadequate in lots of ways to the task of doing design by contract. Having said that, you can still achieve a lot using serialisation of object states and storage of predicates for running before and after a scope.

      Software Engineering is a discipline, not a science. It takes more than mild (in)competence with a sophisticated tool to be scientist.
Software Engineering is a discipline, not an alchemy. All alchemists found meddling in my chosen discipline shall be flayed to within an inch of their sorry lives and then viciously prodded until they renounce their wrongly assumed status.
Software Engineering has much to learn from the rigours of the scientific method, and science has much to heed from the mistakes of software engineering.
