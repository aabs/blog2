      I&rsquo;ve always been a believer in the power of good advertising, which is why I was so pleased to see this fantastic example of the art in Melbourne this week.  It has it all - it has the doleful situation of the foolish dolt who has so willfully left himself in a state of baldness that is, as we can see by the &ldquo;after&rdquo; photo, so obviously reversible. I salute this masterpiece of modern advertising, and hope that television advertisers can learn from it.

      The Wandering Glitch is moving to wordpress.com.
I finally grew irritated with not being able to categorise my blog entries. So I&rsquo;ve moved over to Wordpress, which in some ways is not as good as Blogger (esp the WYSIWYG editing) but blogger broke down the other day, and precipitated this fickle blogger to jump ship. Doubtless I&rsquo;ll be back, but in the meantime I&rsquo;ll be found at http://aabs.wordpress.com/ and if you are Web2.

      I knew I&rsquo;d have to watch my tongue when the kids were old enough to be warped by my cynicism. What I didn&rsquo;t realize was that I&rsquo;d have to watch my nose as well. I think I may have traumatized Thomas' the other day - I&rsquo;ve convinced him that Daddy&rsquo;s head may explode without warning.
It was during bath-time. I covered my face in bubbles which they both thought was hilarious, if a bit strange.

      The initial design that I used when I made the ancestor of norm was based upon designs by Scott Ambler - The initial intent of Ambler&rsquo;s designs was definitely to provide an abstraction around the logic of a relational database. What I want to do with norm is to abstract the very notion of a data structure. When we persist an object into a row on a RDB it is almost irrelevant that the data is persistent.

      Some time back I wrote a quote of the day: There is no greater joy than soaring high on the wings of your dreams, except maybe the joy of watching a dreamer who has nowhere to land but in the ocean of reality. For a moment I though the quote was apropos for Alec Clew&rsquo;s announcement of his apostasy, but after a moment&rsquo;s reflection I realize that it&rsquo;s not.
Alec wrote the other day that, due to driver problems, he was thinking that he may have to depart the sunlit pastures of Gnu/Linux to return to the dreary halls of Windows XP.

      C# in Orcas will provide a bunch of really useful tools for those who want to perform tasks involving reflection. The reflection APIs in C# are already excellent but with the new query capabilities provided by LINQ, Reflection will be a real pleasure. There’ve been a few excellent posts on the topic.
In this post I’ll show you how to use the attribute metadata system to filter types using LINQ. In past posts I’ve talked about the Design By Contract (DBC) system I used to generate pre and post conditions for methods on a class.

        Using Mock Objects When Testing LINQ Code

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I was wondering the other day whether LINQ could be used with NMock easily. One problem with testing code that has not been written to work with unit tests is that if you test business logic, you often end up making multiple round-trips to the database for each test run. With a very large test suite that can turn a few minute&rsquo;s work into hours for a test suite. the best approach to this is to use mock data access components to dispense canned results, rather than going all the way through to the database.

      [digg=http://www.digg.com/programming/Using_RDF_and_C_to_create_an_MP3_Manager_Part_1]This article follows on from the previous post about semantic web applications in C#. I&rsquo;ll be using the SemWeb framework again, but this time I chose to demonstrate the capabilities of RDF by producing a simple MP3 file manager. I haven&rsquo;t completed it yet, and I&rsquo;ll be working on that over the next few days to show you just how easy RDF/OWL is to work with in C# these days.
