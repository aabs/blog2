Think of it as like going to work in dirty underwear. What would your mother think if you were run over in the street, and they found you had been doing Agile?

      Alex Deva has recently written a very persuasive article on the frustrations of Agile development as seen from the far end of an outsourcing agreement. He runs a company in Romania - Indigenous Development - and has past experience of many Agile projects.
I couldn&rsquo;t agree with his observations more. The problems he observes are problems that arise in on-shored and near-shored development models as well. They are inherent weaknesses of Agile.

      Live Labs has now put Photosynth on display to the public. You can&rsquo;t add your own photos yet, but the interface is everything that they promised. I can&rsquo;t wait to be able to use this on my own photos.
I think it will change the way I use my camera. With this interface I will still have to compose pictures that stand alone, since each picture is rendered alone on the screen.

      There are many press releases on the web discussing the wonderful (or terrible, depending on your point of view) development of academic lectures being distributed to the world at large as podcasts. I fall firmly in the camp of those who think such a development is a mark of progress and a step towards realising the dream of free access to high quality ideas and well-thought-out commentary that will support the growth of civilisation in this increasingly dark age that we inhabit.

      A couple of posts ago, I said I&rsquo;d explore the issues of code generation, DBC and ORM. The first thing I wanted to do is address the issue of &lsquo;policy vs configuration&rsquo;. Every project has to address this issue in some way, most systems are developed on a platform that varies from its deployment environment. Most software must be tailored to behave differently on different platforms. Typically, a developer environment is different from a production environment, with some resources replaced by mock objects or stubs.

      The last time I gave some thought to some of the limitations of configuration systems, I was concerned that people use configuration without thought about the consequences. Configuration seems to be a solution of first resort. I was trying to argue that that is probably an unwarranted strategy. It needs to be thought out. I argued in favour of a limitation on configuration. The points I made were:
 The implementation of configuration systems intrude into their client systems unnecessarily.
