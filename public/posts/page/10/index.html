          Grady Booch seems to be back into his stride after his recent illness. In his most recent blog post (Thursday, October 12, 2006) he criticises the unscrupulous advocacy of SOA as though it were a silver bullet. He also points out that any successes of SOA were more than likely due to the application of Architecture, rather than Service Orientation. He points out that SOA is a platform specific kind of message passing architecture that capitalises on the benefits of web technologies to simplify message passing on the internet.

          This from LiveScience via Kurtzweil AI: Monkeys Brains Alter to Work Robotic Arm
A new study finds a monkey&rsquo;s brain structure adapts to treat a robotic arm as if it was a natural appendage. The finding bolsters the notion that the primate brain is highly adaptable, and it adds more knowledge to the effort to create useful prosthetic devices for&hellip;
This is a very thought provoking piece of news. To me it seems to point out the way that awareness inhabits the sensorium, no matter what the origin of that sensorium.

          Here is a simple experiment that will teach you an important electrical lesson: On a cool, dry day, scuff your feet along a carpet, then reach your hand into a friend&rsquo;s mouth and touch one of his dental fillings. Did you notice how your friend twitched violently and cried out in pain? This teaches us that electricity can be a very powerful force, but we must never use it to hurt others unless we need to learn an important electrical lesson.

          Do the fundamentals matter? Last week I was at the Cloud and Data Centre Edge Conference. It was a great trip, and I had the chance to chat with various leaders in the Australian data centre and cloud industry. The conversations continued after the conference was over, and one in particular was with a member of our investment analysis team.
They wanted to know more about UniSuper&rsquo;s data centre policy and my impressions of the conference.

          This time I&rsquo;m going to explore some of the issues I&rsquo;ve found in converting the prototype over to work in a JIT environment. If you&rsquo;ve seen any of my previous posts, you&rsquo;ll know that I have a working prototype that uses static code generation to produce proxies to wrap objects that identify themselves with the DbcAttribute. These proxies are produced solely for those objects, so the developer has to know which items have predicates on them in order to instantiate the proxies rather than the target objects.

          The work is well under way now, and I have reverse engineering, code generation and configuration pretty much sorted out, with a bit of code generation to make the whole thing compile nicely within an AabsNorm generated nant script that will take care of building the domain model, base objects, interfaces, mock objects etc.
At that point I shall put a bit of effort into making some WIX installers to allow me to quickly set up a development environment.

          I am finally getting around to making use of Aabs.Dbc in my new open source porject Aabs.Norm. I figured that the best proving ground for a thing like this is a thing like that. That is, a highly complex, high performance application framework, that maintains a state in a variety of very complex ways, that uses polymorphism and .NET in sophisticated ways, and that will be adversely affected if the performance of Aabs.
