      Today I got my first experience of being caught in a storm of golf ball sized hailstones. We&rsquo;d decided to take the day out and visit the Moomba Festival in the city centre. All was well, and the kids were in a cub scouts arena trying their hands at rock climbing. Suddenly, we heard an ominous rumbling and within seconds we were pelted with inch thick hailstones.
We quickly caught the kids as they fell off the climbing wall, and nobly covered them with our bodies as we hurried them into the canvas awnings that the scoutleaders had erected earlier in the day.

      Recently, Søren Skovsbøll wrote a excellent follow up to a little post I did a while back on using C# 3.0 expression trees for representing predicates in design by contract. The conclusion of that series was that C# was inadequate in lots of ways to the task of doing design by contract. Having said that, you can still achieve a lot using serialisation of object states and storage of predicates for running before and after a scope.

      Software Engineering is a discipline, not a science. It takes more than mild (in)competence with a sophisticated tool to be scientist.
Software Engineering is a discipline, not an alchemy. All alchemists found meddling in my chosen discipline shall be flayed to within an inch of their sorry lives and then viciously prodded until they renounce their wrongly assumed status.
Software Engineering has much to learn from the rigours of the scientific method, and science has much to heed from the mistakes of software engineering.

      According to this BBC report, the UK economy is losing billions to those Nigerian scams. Even though I don&rsquo;t need to explain which scams to those of you who read this - they are proverbial - there are unspeakably avaricious and gullible cretins out there who still send their money into the Nigerian black economy.
I suppose if these people are moronic enough to think that the son/daughter of the Nigerian Mister for transport/embezzlement/finance would single them out from the billions of other candidates to share their booty with, then they deserve what they get.

We attended a very entertaining and engaging lecture held at the Envato offices on Even Sourcing, entitled &ldquo;UPDATE your VIEW on DELETE&rdquo; given by Sebastian von Conrad (@vonconrad). This was a meetup organised by the Melbourne CTO School group with a couple of dozen attendees present.
This isn&rsquo;t the first time that Sebastian has given the talk - the same talk was given to the Software Engineering Institute at CMU, and the video for that is available online.

      here&rsquo;s an old post from literally years ago on the topic of human brain interfaces. I just discovered it languishing in the wordpress drafts section. Not sure how dated it is now (given 7 years of progress since I wrote this) but it would be good to hear what you think today&hellip;
I thought it might be fun to revisit some old territory to see how close we are to being magicians.

      I&rsquo;m not sure whether this feature existed before VS.NET 2008 - it may even be common knowledge that has just passed me by. But I think it&rsquo;s just as cool as hell!
In a source file if you create a breakpoint, you get offered a &lsquo;When Hit&hellip;&rsquo; menu option.
{width=&ldquo;205&rdquo; height=&ldquo;210&rdquo;}
When you click on that you get the following dialog box allowing you to create a breakpoint that does debug window logging!

      For a piece of agent related work I&rsquo;m doing at the moment I am making heavy use of multi-threaded development. I&rsquo;m developing a little special purpose Agent Framework to manage some data that I maintain. As part of that work, I need to have an ambient context object to hold details about the currently active agent and the tasks that it is performing. This is a common pattern that we see used throughout the .

I&rsquo;ve created a project up on sourceforge, and advertised there for help with documentation, installers and general app developers. I&rsquo;ve uploaded an initial source code release - and configured my paypal settings.
I can&rsquo;t wait to see how it is received by the public. Pay the site a visit, and let me know what YOU think. And, of course, if you want to make a donation&hellip; ;o)
