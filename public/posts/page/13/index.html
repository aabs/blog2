          Yes, like all the other gullible fools, with highly reactive immune systems, I have invested my hard-earned money in a mosquito-click (tm). On the tin it says that as few as five clicks will inhibit the histamine reaction and 10 clicks will also neutralise the foriegn matter injected by the insect, by denaturing any proteins in them through electric pressure.
Well, I should have guessed that if I suffered enough from the bites to pay $20, then I was gonna need a lot more than 5 clicks to eradicate the histamine.

          <p>I am so proud of my little angel. She walked a full circuit around her room without any help. It freaked her out a little bit. Especially after she fell over and gave her head a nasty thump. As predicted, she has leapfrogged over the walking stage altogether: She went straight to robotics dancing.</p>

          Having recently been slandered, and accused of being a geek (A geek! Me?) I thought it was about time to share with you all my artistic side. And to do that I thought I would provide a link to a beautiful painting that we saw when we were in Oslo last year (or was it the year before that?) This painting totally captured my imagination, and I haven&rsquo;t seen anything as good in years.

          Thomas Petricek has written a very interesting article on the new concepts behind C# 3.0 (here). It shows the origin of many of the functional programming features found in C# 3.0 from CÏ‰ and F#. Having explored a little of the code that backs up the functional programming aspects, I understand that although the extension run with the basic features of C# 2.0, there is a huge amount of C# code required to deliver the functional paradigm to C#.

          Fern Bud Originally uploaded by Andrew Matthews.
This bud for a tree fern was about the size of my hand with fingers outstretched. It would be great to get a time laps of one of these unfolding. mind you, the humidity would have fritzed my camera way before it got through the sequence.
I love the fractal symmetry in the self similarity on each scale. I wonder how many levels of spiral there are in these buds?

          Since I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of LINQ in the last year or so, I figured that I could improve my C# 3.0 by improving my functional programming. I had two choices of language to explore: Haskell or F#. F# was the obvious choice, I&rsquo;m doing this to be a better C# programmer, right? I don&rsquo;t want to depart too far from C# then.
I&rsquo;m not going to give you the whole F# tutorial (though god knows someone needs to, cos the manual is poor).

          No posts have been forthcoming on this blog, so far, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ve been idle. Far from it! I&rsquo;ve been hard at work till late at night working on the tidying up of the source code. Part of that involved coming up with a new name for the system. There is already a system on GotDotNet (seems like an orphan, but who can tell) called Norm, that is a .

<p>The sad part was it was Andrew Patocs, not Andrew Matthews, who wears the laurel wreath this evening. Andrew Matthews has spent the day in a darkened room wondering why he didn&rsquo;t admit defeat earlier.</p>
<p>Next time I will try harder, cos that so-called bourbon tasted like cheap rum, especially when you have to down 5 shots glasses in 2 minutes cos some chizzling bugger has been practicing&hellip;</p>
