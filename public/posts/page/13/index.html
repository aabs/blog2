      Having recently been slandered, and accused of being a geek (A geek! Me?) I thought it was about time to share with you all my artistic side. And to do that I thought I would provide a link to a beautiful painting that we saw when we were in Oslo last year (or was it the year before that?) This painting totally captured my imagination, and I haven&rsquo;t seen anything as good in years.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Thomas Petricek has written a very interesting article on the new concepts behind C# 3.0 (here). It shows the origin of many of the functional programming features found in C# 3.0 from CÏ‰ and F#. Having explored a little of the code that backs up the functional programming aspects, I understand that although the extension run with the basic features of C# 2.0, there is a huge amount of C# code required to deliver the functional paradigm to C#.

      Fern Bud Originally uploaded by Andrew Matthews.
This bud for a tree fern was about the size of my hand with fingers outstretched. It would be great to get a time laps of one of these unfolding. mind you, the humidity would have fritzed my camera way before it got through the sequence.
I love the fractal symmetry in the self similarity on each scale. I wonder how many levels of spiral there are in these buds?

      Since I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of LINQ in the last year or so, I figured that I could improve my C# 3.0 by improving my functional programming. I had two choices of language to explore: Haskell or F#. F# was the obvious choice, I&rsquo;m doing this to be a better C# programmer, right? I don&rsquo;t want to depart too far from C# then.
I&rsquo;m not going to give you the whole F# tutorial (though god knows someone needs to, cos the manual is poor).

      No posts have been forthcoming on this blog, so far, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ve been idle. Far from it! I&rsquo;ve been hard at work till late at night working on the tidying up of the source code. Part of that involved coming up with a new name for the system. There is already a system on GotDotNet (seems like an orphan, but who can tell) called Norm, that is a .

The sad part was it was Andrew Patocs, not Andrew Matthews, who wears the laurel wreath this evening. Andrew Matthews has spent the day in a darkened room wondering why he didn&rsquo;t admit defeat earlier.
Next time I will try harder, cos that so-called bourbon tasted like cheap rum, especially when you have to down 5 shots glasses in 2 minutes cos some chizzling bugger has been practicing&hellip;

      I&rsquo;ve posted a whole bunch (well 45) bugs on the GotDotNet bug tracker for enhancements that nORM should not have to live too long without. Some of them ought to be fairly easy to deliver, like changing method names to have a clean and consistent format. Others are a bit more of a challenge - like adding persistence support for XML documents and reverse engineering an entity model from a schema file.

      Fishdots v1 and its plugins were groaning under their own weight. It&rsquo;s in-memory function definitions model, inherited from before it was even a fishy thing, led to some serious load time lag. Combine that with extensive use of tmux, and you have a recipe for frustration!
The repo fishdots2 ports everything over to use the inate autoloading capabilities of fish shell. In the process of the rewrite, I&rsquo;ve taken the chance to break it up, and make it simpler and more clearly focused.
