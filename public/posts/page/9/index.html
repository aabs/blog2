    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      The configuration of applications is a reflex action these days. Programmers assume the need for a config system without reflection and then move on to wondering howthey will implement it. I&rsquo;ve spent a bit of time lately wondering how many of these standard practices of configuration are ill-pre-conceived opinions. Do they deserve the merit that they have? I con&rsquo;t help but think that most of the times I use config it&rsquo;s out of habit, and the vague idea that it adds to my system somehow.

      Olmo made a very worthwhile suggestion on the LINQ forums recently. His suggestion was for a new operator to be added to the C# language to allow us to do away with the following kind of pesky construct:
 [sourcecode language='csharp']string x; if(a != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; a.Address != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; a.Address.FirstLine != null) x = a.Address.FirstLine;[/sourcecode]  instead he suggested a new ?. operator so that we could produce something like this:

      Well, then end of another contract looms. Telstra have been my &ldquo;hosts&rdquo; for the last few months. I would like to believe that it has not been a parasitic relationship. A parasite is &ldquo;an organism that grows, feeds, and is sheltered on or in a different organism while contributing nothing to the survival of its host&rdquo;. Sadly though, I must admit that, try as I might, I was able to contribute little more than a few (beautifully typeset) documents that were promptly applauded then ignored.

      I spent most of my evening converting Jena to .NET. Needless to say it was only at the end of the evening that I discovered that Andy Seabourne (from my old home town of Bristol) had already worked out how to use IKVM to convert the jar files into assemblies. I&rsquo;m not bothered though; I produced make files (rather than shell scripts) that work better on cygwin. The best thing I got from Andy was his &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry be happy&rdquo; advice that IKVM spuriously complains about unfound classes - you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it.

      New scientist is carrying a story about the use of cord blood in the preparation of embryonic stem cells. When K &amp; I saw references to preservation of cord blood around the hospital we thought that it was to be preserved for later use by the baby in the case of operations and anemia. Now I am wondering whether they actually want it for other people. In which case my eagerness is slightly less!

      Well, EDS seemed grim-in-the-extreme, they want someone to spend two months writing some godawful burocratic change request document for some Telstra billing department. I think that my facial expression may have hinted at the miasmic feeling of despondency and depression I felt at the prospect of having to wade neck-deep through so much pointless paper. I doubt I&rsquo;ll hear back from them, especially after asking to see one of their documents to check the level of design they wanted from me - only to discover that there was none!

      As promised last time, I have extended the query mechanism of my little application with a LINQ Query Provider. I based my initial design on the method published by Bart De Smet, but have extended that framework, cleaned it up and tied it in with the original object deserialiser for SemWeb (a semantic web library by Joshua Tauberer).
In this post I&rsquo;ll give you some edited highlights of what was involved.

      Grady Booch seems to be back into his stride after his recent illness. In his most recent blog post (Thursday, October 12, 2006) he criticises the unscrupulous advocacy of SOA as though it were a silver bullet. He also points out that any successes of SOA were more than likely due to the application of Architecture, rather than Service Orientation. He points out that SOA is a platform specific kind of message passing architecture that capitalises on the benefits of web technologies to simplify message passing on the internet.
