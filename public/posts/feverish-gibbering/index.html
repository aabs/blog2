    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Memetically, I&rsquo;m lying in my bed sweating till the sheets are drenched.</p>
<p>Memetically, the family is stood around the foot of my bed and the priest has been called up from the village.</p>
<p>Memetically, I am raving while the hospital staff tie straps to my arms and legs to prevent me from hurting myself.</p>
<p>Memetically, I am on the back of a wagon being taken to the unmarked grave called &ldquo;<em><strong>yuletide casualties</strong></em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Yes, Christmas is here to provide the memetic straw that breaks this camel&rsquo;s back. I was already infected by the recent wave of Wiggles that was going around (the <em>Di Dickey Doo Dum</em> even shows on my face, and if the office is too quiet people can hear my subvocalised <em>Big Red Cars</em>). Add to that the background malaise from all that twinkle twinkling and the <em>blind mice</em> that race up and down my spine (presumably competing for mind-space with the <em>little piggies</em>) at night.</p>
<p>But now I am mordant with memes that are thick as fleas on a dogs back – it is Christmas and the new rash of novelty singing toys are out. Kerry and her mother thought it was in the yuletide spirit to have about a dozen of these monstrosities wandering the house singing songs that are so virulent they should be ranked alongside military grade bioweapons.</p>
<p>I know the ill-disciplined mind of a child needs something <em><strong>seriously</strong></em> catchy to get an idea through the background noise of the forming mind. The effect on us adults, though, is little short of being mustard gassed in the trenches for a solid month.</p>
<p>That sacred space that is the core of a centred mind is, in my case, so infected with viral memes it bears more than a passing resemblance to an ambulatory slime mould.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t get me started on those ruddy 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s Xmas tunes from the likes of Bing Crosby.</p>
<p>No meme would be worth its salt if it didn&rsquo;t compel me to sing you a song, so here goes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m the happiest Christmas tree – Ho Ho Ho. He He He.
Came one day, and they found me, and took me home with them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got tiny bells that tinkle,
And tiny little lights that twinkle
And if anybody passes by
I wink my lights, and blink my eyes!</p>
<p>Oooh, I&rsquo;m the happiest Christmas tree,
Christmas day – wait and see
I&rsquo;ll be laughing happily
With a Ho Ho Ho He Heeeee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, it doesn&rsquo;t sound right unless it&rsquo;s accompanied by a banjo and a red flashing nose.</p>
<p>HHHHHEEEEEELLLLLLLPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Oh, and a merry Christmas to you!</p>
