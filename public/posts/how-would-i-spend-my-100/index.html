<p>$5 - (0) Parallel algorithms (Comp Sci., technology agnostic)

$5 - (2) Windows concurrency internals
$5 - (3) CLR concurrency internals
$5 - (4) Windows (Win32) concurrency API best practices

$5 - (6) Client-side concurrency
$5 - (7) Server-side concurrency
$5 - (8) Reusable concurrency primitives (building and using them)
$5 - (9) Performance and scalability
$50 - (A) Debugging</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why. [<em><strong>Because debugging concurrent systems is Ruddy Hard!!!!!</strong></em>]{style=&ldquo;text-decoration:underline;&quot;} I wish I had $200 [J]{style=&ldquo;font-family:Wingdings;&quot;}</p>
