say, my mind is buzzing from the fire-hose brain-dump he&rsquo;s doing on us at the
moment. It&rsquo;s wonderful to see someone so deeply in command of the technology,
not to mention daunting at the sheer incline of the learning curve. He&rsquo;s had
some influence on the development of both C# and Visual Studio as well as WCF,
so it&rsquo;s not surprising that he has sprinkled the course with some elegant little
language features that joined the dots for me. With 1400 slides in his slide
deck, there&rsquo;s plenty of space for language digressions as well.</p>
<p>One favorite of mine was the use of the new lambda function notation in the
course of everyday UI and multithreaded development. Wherever you see a
delegate, callback or handler in your normal code you can now make use of a
lambda function. Of course this won&rsquo;t be news to the functional programmers out
there, but within a few years there will be more functional code in production
environments via C# than ever came from pure functional languages.</p>
<pre><code>[TestMethod] public static void TestLambdas() {   for (int i = 0; i &lt; 300; i++)   {     Thread t = new Thread((x) =&gt;       {         Thread.CurrentThread.Name = x.ToString();         Thread.Sleep(r.Next(250, 500));         Trace.WriteLine(string.Format(&quot;Hello from thread {0}&quot;,           Thread.CurrentThread.Name));       });     t.Start(&quot;T &quot; + i);   }   Thread.Sleep(10000); }
</code></pre>
<p>This is nice and clean, and will prevent any nasty proliferation of one line event handlers.</p>
