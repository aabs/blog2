<p>Expect to see a resurgance of blogging on this site, as I introduce you to my new open source project.</p>
<p>Expect to hear a bit about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709420.aspx">MGrammar</a>, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/Pex/">PEX</a>, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/">F#</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell">Powershell</a>, and declarative architecture specifications&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; I&rsquo;m excited. New toys to play with and some amazing new productivity enhancements to play with&hellip;</p>
