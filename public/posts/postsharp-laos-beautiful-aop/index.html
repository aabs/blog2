    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I&rsquo;ve recently been using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd140063.aspx">PostSharp</a> 1.5 (<a href="http://doc.postsharp.org/1.5/##PostSharp.HxS/UserGuide/Laos/Overview.html">Laos</a>) to implement various features such as logging, tracing, API performance counter recording, and repeatability on the softphone app I&rsquo;ve been developing. Previously, we&rsquo;d been either using hand-rolled code generation systems to augment the APIs with IDisposable-style wrappers, or hand coded the wrappers within the implementation code. The problem was that by the time we&rsquo;d added all of the above, there were hundreds of lines of code to maintain around the few lines of code that actually provided a business benefit.</p>
<p>Several years ago, when I worked for Avanade, I worked on a very large scale project that used the Avanade Connected Architecture (<a href="http://www.avanade.com/delivery/acanet/">ACA.NET</a>) - a proprietary competitor for PostSharp. We found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">Aspect Oriented Programming</a> (AOP) to be a great way to focus on the job at hand and reliably dot all the &lsquo;i&rsquo;s and cross all the &rsquo;t&rsquo;s in a single step at a later date.</p>
<p>ACA.NET, at that time, used a precursor of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd140063.aspx">P&amp;P Configuration Application Block</a> and performed a form of post build step to create external wrappers that instantiated the aspect call chain prior to invoking your service method. That was a very neat step that could allow configurable specifications of applicable aspects. It allowed us to develop the code in a very naive in-proc way, and then augment the code with top level exception handlers, transactionality etc at the same time that we changed the physical deployment architecture. Since that time, I&rsquo;ve missed the lack of such a tool, so it was a pleasure to finally acquaint myselfÂ  with PostSharp.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d always been intending to introduce PostSharp here, but I&rsquo;d just never had time to do it. Well, I finally found the time in recent weeks and was able to do that most gratifying thing - remove and simplify code, improve performance and code quality, reduced maintenance costs and increased the ease with I introduce new code <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy-based_design">policies</a> all in a single step. And all without even scratching the surface of what PostSharp is capable of.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a little example of the power of AOP using PostSharp, inspired by <a href="http://elevate.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/changeset/view/44244?projectName=elevate#690734">Elevate&rsquo;s memoize extension method</a>. We try to distinguish as many of our APIs as possible into Pure and Impure. Those that are impure get database locks, retry handlers etc. Those that are pure <em>in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">functional sense</a></em> can be cached, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoize">memoized</a>. Those that are not pure in a functional sense are those that while not saving any data still are not one-to-one between arguments and result, sadly that&rsquo;s most of mine (it&rsquo;s a distributed event driven app).</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[Serializable]
public class PureAttribute : OnMethodInvocationAspect
{
    Dictionary&lt;int, object&gt; PreviousResults = new Dictionary&lt;int, object&gt;();

    public override void OnInvocation(MethodInvocationEventArgs eventArgs)
    {
        int hashcode = GetArgumentArrayHashcode(eventArgs.Method, eventArgs.GetArgumentArray());
        if (PreviousResults.ContainsKey(hashcode))
            eventArgs.ReturnValue = PreviousResults[hashcode];
        else
        {
            eventArgs.Proceed();
            PreviousResults[hashcode] = eventArgs.ReturnValue;
        }
    }

    public int GetArgumentArrayHashcode(MethodInfo method, params object[] args)
    {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder(method.GetHashCode().ToString());

        foreach (object item in args)
            result.Append(item);
        return result.ToString().GetHashCode();
    }
}

<p>I love what I achieved here, not least for the fact that it took me no more than about 20 lines of code to do it. But that&rsquo;s not the real killer feature, for me. It&rsquo;s the fact that PostSharp Laos has <a href="http://doc.postsharp.org/1.5/##PostSharp.HxS/UserGuide/Laos/Multicasting/Overview.html">MulticastAttributes</a>, that allow me to apply the advice to numerous methods in a single instruction, or even numerous classes or even every method of every class of an assembly. I can specify what to attach the aspects to by using regular expressions, or wildcards. Here&rsquo;s an example that applies an aspect to all public methods in class MyServiceClass.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[assembly: Pure(
    AspectPriority = 2,
    AttributeTargetAssemblies = &quot;MyAssembly&quot;,
    AttributeTargetTypes = &quot;UiFacade.MyServiceClass&quot;,
    AttributeTargetMemberAttributes = MulticastAttributes.Public,
    AttributeTargetMembers = &quot;*&quot;)]
</code></pre><p><a href="http://11011.net/software/vspaste"></a></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example that uses a wildcard to NOT apply the aspect to those methods that end in &ldquo;Impl&rdquo;.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[assembly: Pure(
    AspectPriority = 2,
    AttributeTargetAssemblies = &quot;MyAssembly&quot;,
    AttributeTargetTypes = &quot;UiFacade.MyServiceClass&quot;,
    AttributeTargetMemberAttributes = MulticastAttributes.Public,
    AttributeExclude = true,
    AttributeTargetMembers = &quot;*Impl&quot;)]
</code></pre><p>Do you use AOP? What aspects do you use, other than the usual suspects above?</p>
