His point is that no project will succeed if it is badly run. I&rsquo;d be the first to admit that in some cases, I should probably have stood my ground or found a more stable compromise. But we have to admit that many project managers are likely to be less savvy or less principled than Alec.</p>
<p>The reason we learn as we go along in an Agile project is because we never asked enough questions to begin with! The whole point of an up-front intensive design phase is to bring as many of those <em>&lsquo;doh</em>!&rsquo; moments ahead of the development phase as we can. Catching a design (or requirements) flaw midway through a project is definitely better than catching it after delivery. But catching them <em>during</em> the design process is even better. Everything changes around us because those who ought to have given more thought to the requirements have postponed thinking (indefinitely?). What can <em><strong>reasonably</strong></em> be delayed? My initial gripe is that one man&rsquo;s reason is another man&rsquo;s madness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting that we drop Agile and go back to waterfall models (although maybe we should for big projects). All I really want is that we feel obligated to think before we act. Is that so much to ask?</p>
