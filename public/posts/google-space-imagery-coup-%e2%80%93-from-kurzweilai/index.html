<p>[I wonder who else Google is talking to? The Human Genome Project? The Visible Human Project? Interpol? Imagine if they made it possible for researchers to publish their data sets when they publish a paper&hellip; Maybe in future, readers of scientific papers can draw their own conclusions about the validity of results by running their own analysis of the results. It might improve the quality of research if scientists knew that their results would come under greater scrutiny?
