I spent years bemoaning the fact that the laws of physics didn&rsquo;t allow the wireless transmission of power. Now it seems that I bemoaned prematurely. Researchers at MIT have a found a way to use inductance to power a 60W (think similar power rating to a laptop) lightbulb from a distance of up to 2 metres.
I know it doesn&rsquo;t sound like much, but as I look at my desk I can&rsquo;t help thinking that a short range power transmitter would help.">

<p>I spent years bemoaning the fact that the laws of physics didn&rsquo;t allow the wireless transmission of power. Now it seems that I bemoaned prematurely. Researchers at MIT have a <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/18836/">found a way</a> to use inductance to power a 60W (think similar power rating to a laptop) lightbulb from a distance of up to 2 metres.</p>
<p>I Â know it doesn&rsquo;t sound like much, but as I look at my desk I can&rsquo;t help thinking that a short range power transmitter would help. I&rsquo;m sure it beats Quartz crystals as a source of magic moonbeams as well.</p>
