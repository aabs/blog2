    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>In my <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=999808">notation</a> a simple grammatical structure is represented as a triple of the form [subject | action | object] with elements of the triple annotated with gliphs to represent tense, belief etc.</p>
<p>One of the elements that has never satisfied me is constructions that are kind of three way sentences such as &ldquo;john threw the ball to tom&rdquo;
which in the notation is represented as [john | throw_p | &lt;to, tom, ball&gt;] It could of course be written as two statements</p>
<p>[john | throw_p | ball]
[ball.target = tom]</p>
<p>But this is a little long winded, so what I need is to be able to consisely represent such a common sentence structure using N.</p>
<p>Any ideas? How about [john | throw_p | [ball.target = tom]]
still makes me think that we don&rsquo;t break up the meaning of the sentence in that way when we use the three way construction, so what is going on in our heads? Is there a third party along with the subject and object?</p>
