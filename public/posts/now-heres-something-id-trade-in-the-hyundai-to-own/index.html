This Toyota concept car seems to have adopted the Fisher-Price/Window Media Player user interface approach to ergonomics. I&rsquo;m not sure whether the dashboard is a touch screen, but I love the idea of exploring the object model of the car. I also love the idea of being able to control the car using a touch screen keyboard. In this age of automatic gearboxes and speed limiters, there is no reason for us still to be pulling and pushing levers to control the car - it&rsquo;s a technological throwback, a bit like when a plane&rsquo;s ailerons were controlled by cables attached to the joystick. That age has long past, but we still use joysticks - why?</p>
<p>Bring on the coffee cup holder keyboard to set gears and speeds. In fact why not control speed using an iPod scroll wheel? I suspect it will be a while before something like this filters out to the public, but I look forward to the day.</p>
