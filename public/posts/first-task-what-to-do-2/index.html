    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I&rsquo;ve posted a whole bunch (well 45) bugs on the GotDotNet bug tracker for enhancements that nORM should not have to live too long without.

<p>I think that delivering these bits of functionality will take quite a while. If each of these things took an average of a week to do (which is optimistic!) It would take me about a year to deliver all of the enhancements. But by the end of that - the system will kick some serious arse!</p>
