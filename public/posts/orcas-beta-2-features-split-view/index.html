That is - you are shown the design and markup views side by side just as in the visual designer for WPF.

<p>If you need to turn off the default split view, to prevent VS from hanging for several minutes till it&rsquo;s rendering attempts timeout, then you will need to go into the Options dialog and change the settings. Goto <strong>Tools&gt;Options&gt;HTML Designer</strong> and select the <strong>Source View</strong> setting. That will change the default mode that the page will open in. It&rsquo;s a great improvement on VS2005, where if you double clicked on a web form you had little option but to wait for it to timeout.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a wide screen display, you might want to check &ldquo;<strong>Split views vertically</strong>&rdquo;, to allow you to see more lines of source.</p>
