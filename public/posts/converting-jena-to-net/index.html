    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I spent most of my evening converting <a href="http://jena.sf.net">Jena</a> to .NET.
Needless to say it was only at the end of the evening that I discovered that
Andy Seabourne (from my old home town of Bristol) had already worked out how to
use <a href="http://www.ikvm.net">IKVM</a> to
<a href="http://seaborne.blogspot.com/2006/02/progress-with-jenanet.html">convert</a> the
jar files into assemblies. I&rsquo;m not bothered though; I produced make files
(rather than shell scripts) that work better on cygwin. The best thing I got
from Andy was his &ldquo;<em>don&rsquo;t worry be happy</em>&rdquo; advice that IKVM spuriously complains
about unfound classes - you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it. Once I read that, I
realised that I had successfully converted Jena about 4 hours earlier, and all
my fiddling about trying to get the right pattern of dependencies was completely
unnecessary - IKVM just works! (and rocks)</p>
<p>Had I realised just how easy it was to convert bytecode to IL, I might have gone
trawling the apache <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">jakarta</a> project more often
over the last few years. (sigh) Never mind - I now have the tools for working on
semantic web applications in .NET. Yayyyy!!!! I don&rsquo;t have to learn Python
either. I&rsquo;m not sure whether I&rsquo;m sad about that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a place handy to put the assemblies, and wordpress won&rsquo;t allow me
to upload them, so I&rsquo;ll do the next best thing and give you the make file. It
assumes that you are using cygwin or something similar. If you aren&rsquo;t just use
the conventional windows path structure for ikvmdir. It also is based on Jena
version 2.5.2.</p>
