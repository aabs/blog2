      <title>Implementing a Triple Store from the Ground Up - Part 1</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve long been fascinated with semantic web technologies, the potential of RDF and understanding how to implement a triple store from the ground up. Databases are one of those technologies - like compilers - that we often take for granted, and yet which beneath the hood employs some very sophisticated algorithms and data structures to achieve acceptable levels of performance.
In this new article series, I&amp;rsquo;ll implement a triple store using techniques introduced in recent years for efficiently storing and processing indexes on large knowledge graphs.</description>

      <description>The first thing we need to do to build a database is to find a fast way to read from and write to disk. Whether we are doing I/O on a hard drive or an SSD, the interface to the disk typically works the same. It transfers data into and out of the disk in &amp;lsquo;pages&amp;rsquo; or blocks of data.
It makes sense to keep data we are likely to access together in the same page so that it is already in memory when we need to access it.</description>

      <description>When you suddenly discover that your disk is full, consider doing the following:
 Work out where the disk is being used, with tree size free  $ cinst -y treesizefree If you don&amp;rsquo;t use hibernation on your machine you could save a lot of space by turning it off  $ powercfg.exe /hibernate off Compact the WSL disk if you use WSL  $ wsl --shutdown $ optimize-vhd -Path &amp;quot;C:\Users\a30006806\AppData\Local\Docker\wsl\data\ext4.</description>

      <description>Last week I mentioned that I was starting a rewrite of Fishdots. Well, a few of the plugins have now been ported over to the new instance of FD, which from now on I will call fd2.
They are:
  aabs/fish_checklists
A fish plugin supporting production of event based checklists
  aabs/fish_git
Simple fish plugin with some helpful git abbrs and functions
  aabs/fish_subcmd
Fish shell plugin providing functions to set up multi-level commands (like git)</description>

      <description>Last time I showed how to write RDF in Turtle, and how to make very simple queries in SPARQL. What I didn&amp;rsquo;t show was how to get your hands dirty. Specifically, I want to show you how to try things out on the cheap command line. I will show examples of how to build out your RDF data to more depth using Turtle files, and how to use the Jena framework to create queries against that data, so you can work out ahead of time how to navigate your graph of data.</description>

      <description>Last time I showed you how to use CLI tools to build out your RDF data to more depth using Turtle files and how to query it using the Apache Jena CLI toolchain using SPARQL Query language. This time I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to insert and retrieve data from a remote triple store. I&amp;rsquo;ll continue using the CLI tools for now.

      <description>This is the first in a short series introducing Knowledge Graphs. It covers just the basics, showing how to write, store, query and work with graph data using RDF (short for Resource Description Format). I will keep it free of theory and interesting but unnecessary digressions. Let me know in the comments if you find it useful, and also tell me what other Knowledge Graph topics you would like to know more about.</description>

      <description>[digg=http://digg.com/general_sciences/2000_Year_Old_Computer_Recreated]Archaeologists from the University of Cardiff have finally worked out how to put together a complex mechanism that was found in the 2000 year old ruins of a sunken boat off the coast of Greece. The announcement was impressive because this mechanical calculating device had defied researcher&amp;rsquo;s attempts to understand it for over a hundred years. The device was used to calculate the position of both the moon and the sun during their orbit, and to calculate eclipses with remarkable accuracy.</description>

      <description>Researchers at the University of Texas have developed a technique to create artificial muscle fibres using Carbon Nanotubes woven into a yarn a mere 2 microns thick. Each fibre has a strength equal to 100 times that of equivalent human muscle fibres. It is a expected that there will have revolutionary consequences for the prosthetic limb and robotics fields. I wonder whether the long-term outlook will be for elective muscular enhancement.</description>

      <description>I love to be educated. I also love the fact that I can absorb new ideas continuously without ever sating my thirst for data. And where better than at Wikipedia, which has obviously been lavished with the attentions of a database expert in recent days. I have to admit that I have never heard of, let alone worked on a dimensional database, so I am intrigued to know more.</description>

      <description>For years I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a design pattern I picked up back in my Java days to help me make legacy classes more testable with Mock objects. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a few doubts about it, but it&amp;rsquo;s been useful so many times that I&amp;rsquo;ve never bothered to change it. I always keep a handy code snippet for it on my dev machines and I can knock them out in seconds. I don&amp;rsquo;t like it because I have to create a new class factory for every type that I want to control.</description>

      <description>Fishdots has grown so much that it&amp;rsquo;s taking up too much space, and shell load time is getting unweildy. So, I&amp;rsquo;ve started a rewrite, based on the standard approach for autoloading using the plugin layout recommended by fisher plugin manager. That means a whole bunch of new repos, and probably some refactoring for fishdots.
I&amp;rsquo;ve created a Fisher plugin template to use as the basis for each of the plugins I rewrite.</description>

      <description>About 6 years ago I read a book by Edward de Bono, called modestly the de Bono Code Book. His idea was to devise a representation for thoughts and statements that went beyond the simple propositions from predicate logic. Initially, I was intrigued by the idea that I could learn to represent ideas in a way that was both terse, unambiguous and that enhanced my abilities to reason on paper. I quickly became disillusioned by the notation because it was both arbitrary and incomprehensible; there was no obvious way (as far as I could make out) for representing an arbitrary thought.</description>

      <description>Migraine patients who received true acupuncture had no decrease in headaches as compared with those who received sham acupuncture treatment, according to a study in the May 4 issue of JAMA.
It surprises me that this has not been identified before. Yet another example of the healing power of the mind. It&amp;rsquo;s currently fashionable to criticise western medicine in favour of esoteric chinese medicine, so I wonder how long before the report is accused of rationalist, reductionist bias (As though that were a bad thing).</description>

      <description>Tony says he&amp;rsquo;s had a hard time persuading Portals to &amp;lsquo;get&amp;rsquo; the advantages of Web2.0. I guess the portals would get Web2.0 from a usability perspective. It makes sense for them not to divert a little effort to it - most of Web2.0 can be built for very little cost on top of existing functionality (it&amp;rsquo;s not rocket science after all!) But then - some of them have been around long enough to want to try to fall into the &amp;lsquo;bank&amp;rsquo; category - i.</description>

      <description>My data recovery program has started to recover files. Can you believe it? It took two whole weeks for R-Studio to index the contents of my MP3 drive. This 200GB drive got nadgered by a nice combination of travelling to work on my back every day and being used in combination with Windows XP Pro SP2 and hibernation. Just as well I didn&amp;rsquo;t keep anything on there that was of immediate importance&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Alfred Thompson recently blogged about an interesting interview given by Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of C++, now professor of computer science at Texas A&amp;amp;M University. As ever the interviewers were after his prescription for the Silver Bullet that will save us all from ourselves. Alfred has already boiled down the interview to a couple of interesting sound bites, and I aim to do the same to his post. The quote that particularly caught my attention was Stroustrup&amp;rsquo;s comment on the &amp;lsquo;pragmatic&amp;rsquo; way in which modern software gets developed.</description>

      <description>Alec, a man of great perspicacity, and wisdom, has granted us another Agile pearl of wisdom. All of which is totally correct. There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that if you are with The Complicators, then you can screw up a product no matter what method you follow.
Let&amp;rsquo;s just try a thought experiment though – Imagine you&amp;rsquo;d been disciplined and hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought of the future at all, and you&amp;rsquo;d designed your system solely to work on RJE 2780.</description>

There are still quite a few things I ought to do before making any attempt to publicise it. I thought that since I&amp;rsquo;ve been very remiss in not posting to this blog lately I could do some posting. How better than to list what I&amp;rsquo;ve got to do before the system is unveiled to the public?</description>

      <description>As you will recall from the previous post, I have been wondering about how to implement the functionality for dynamic proxies. Well I saw this great article, by Viji Sarathy, on the web, and think that this might be the way to go.
It uses Context Bound Objects to ensure the interception of all calls by the CLR without any explicit framework setup by the user. We can guarantee that the contracts get followed, whether the user tries to evade them or not.</description>

I only have 20 minutes to talk so I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to go into too much depth. What I do hope to do is persuade the audience that LINQ is worthy of their attention. If I can persuade a few people to go out and develop their own query providers, then even better.</description>

      <description>Normally I have a very optimistic outlook. Especially when it comes to technological breakthroughs. But this morning I was given pause for thought. MAKE magazine carried a news article today about a highly accurate DNA replicator for $10. I am fully convinced that such breakthroughs can be used to tackle the issues of world poverty, but I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished reading Tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s War by David Shukman. It was written over 10 years ago but was gloomy, even then about our chances of controlling the proliferation of expertise in the production of WMD, and it was written before 9/11.</description>

      <description>Dom suggested that &amp;ldquo;The distance to our goals always seems further to those realists without sufficient knowledge.&amp;rdquo;. My personal experience in software indicates that when you are attempting to solve a difficult problem with many unknowns, you cannot predict the degree of complexity of the problem or solution without actually solving the problem. Good estimation in a software project is an exercise in pessimism. I also find that my pessimism is never enough!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m proud to say that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally uploaded version 0.7 of LinqToRdf. This is by far the best release of LinqToRdf (so far), and it now contains full support for relationship navigation out of the box. Relationship support has always been possible (provided you were intimately familiar with various undocumented parts of LINQ:), but with the automated support for instance URIs that came in version 0.6, it&amp;rsquo;s now automatic.
The high points of the release are:</description>

Firstly, because it provides a preview release of RdfMetal and secondly because it is the first release containing changes contributed by someone other than yours truly. The changes in this instance being provided by Carl Blakeley of OpenLink Software.
LinqToRdf v0.8 has received a few major chunks of work:</description>

I just read a very interesting post by Tony Wright, on the relative cost of fixing a bug in different stages of a project. Do we need a better justification for applying a little bit of forethought to a problem before rushing headlong into the implementation phase of a project?</description>

      <description>In a conversation I had with a colleague, it came to light that the British have another reason to be proud of their national heritage. As you may know, they were the nation that invented the queue. they take to the queue as ducks take to water, and queueticette is installed in their youth from the cradle. Not content with that, the British graduated in the 70s from simple linear queues to more complicated non-linear arrangements.</description>

But according to a new analysis we are fast approaching a new dark age. The results show that the number of technological breakthroughs and patents peaked a century ago and have been falling steadily ever since.

The music began with Allegri&amp;rsquo;s Misereri which blew us both away, but the music continued to improve (IMHO) with the Part part. The choir sang in that gorgeous subsonic Russian orthodox christian style with edgy dissonances that fixate your attention.</description>

And it seems that some of us (and I&amp;rsquo;m including myself in this camp till proven otherwise) are born with an inherited tendency to feel more pain than others. This curse is known as &amp;ldquo;primary erythromelalgia&amp;rdquo;. And is somehow related to a defective sodium channel in the pain signalling neurons. I blame my parents.

I was cruising around the ID3.org site looking for a .NET ID3 tag API, when I came upon AudioFiler. AudioFiler is a great application, and one I&amp;rsquo;ve been searching for for years. Perhaps I should explain. I started creating and collecting MP3s back in about 1997, and since then my collection has grown a little. Back then there was a cool tool called TrackManager, by Nick de Jong.</description>

Proving that Cockroaches are not indestructible, Kerry neatly (if inadvertently) demonstrated that Australian port is capable of killing things that heat, cold and lethal levels of ionizing radiation cannot.
Of course Kerry was gagging for days just at the thought that the thing had been in her glass all along – it probably hadn’t – but I forgot to mention that anything that can kill a cockroach can surely kill the bacteria that the cockroach carries…</description>

      <description>Petri Nets are extremely powerful and expressive, but they are not as widely used in the software development community as deterministic state machines. That&amp;rsquo;s a pity - they allow us to solve problems beyond the reach of conventional state machines. This is the first in a mini-series on software development with Petri Nets. All of the code for a full feature-complete Petri Net library is available online at GitHub. You&amp;rsquo;re welcome to take a copy, play with it and use it in your own projects.</description>

      <description>I recently came across the Dryad project at MS Research. It is concerned with the development of automated systems to deploy sequential systems across parallel platforms. This is an interesting and topical issue at the moment because the advent of multi-core processors poses problems for developers. In C#, at the very least, there is no inherent parallelization of the language. Developers have to explicitly code a system with threading or grid computing in mind.</description>

      <description>Software svengali Alec Clews has recently delineated a methodology that brings together the best of both the Agile and Waterfall worlds into a single edible package that will keep us in work for years to come. The methodological guru said &amp;ldquo;BDALAP recognises that certain design decisions are a) complex and b) have far reaching implications&amp;rdquo;. The solution, he says, is to perform Big Design As Late As Possible.
Of course, an Agile exponent would say that &amp;ldquo;as late as possible&amp;rdquo; would be when the application proves not to scale.</description>

      <description>Well, not quite firstborn yet - but we are now into the second trimester so things are going to be more stable from now on! First official diagnosis on the status of the twins indicates that they are in fact - jumping beans&amp;hellip; You can tell that baby 2 takes after her mother.
Codenamed baby 1 and baby 2 prior to launch.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s clear that the unofficial policy of both Microsoft and Google is &amp;ldquo;we don&amp;rsquo;t believe in the semantic web&amp;rdquo;. It may not be clear why. The answer is unsurprising when you give it some thought, though: Big Business. Semantic search holds out the hope of users being able to compose meaningful queries and get relevant results. The price is that someone somewhere has to write down the answers in a meaningful way.</description>

      <description>Well, I&amp;rsquo;m back in work - a fact that would normally be an occasion for mourning. But, at least on this occasion, I am settling in OK. I am doing a short contract for a local classified ads company called the trading post (if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen the movie The Castle, you&amp;rsquo;ll recognise the name). I will be working on redeveloping their admin back-end, and shall get more stored procedure practice than at any other time in my programming career.</description>

This is how he escaped last time:
If the contractor wages go down to 10GBP/hr again, Aggy, I shall be blaming you!!!!!

      <description>I produced this list for Chris Palmer, who was interested in doing some background research on design patterns, design issues and programming best practice. I was planning on just jotting down some titles as they occurred to me, but when I sat down to think about all the books (of Computer Science or programming) that had inspired me, the list began to grow and grow. So I thought it might be worth committing it to a blog entry that I can refer to and extend later on.</description>

Given the recent history of US administrations to &amp;lsquo;reclassify&amp;rsquo; atrocities as &amp;lsquo;not genocide&amp;rsquo; to not be morally obligated, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised.</description>

      <description>Steve Eichert and Bart de Smet both posted last November about a new C# feature: Automatic Properties.
The language enhancement will convert code like this in a class definition:
[public string MyProperty { get; set; } ]{style=&amp;ldquo;font-family:Courier New;font-size:8pt;&amp;quot;}
Into something like this:
[private string myProperty; public string MyProperty { get{return myProperty;} set{myProperty = value;} } ]{style=&amp;ldquo;font-family:Courier New;font-size:8pt;&amp;quot;}
I&amp;rsquo;ve got to admit that I view this with a few misgivings. Primarily, I worry about how to interpret MyProperty in an abstract or virtual class.</description>

      <description>Last time I created a simple, but powerful, little design by contract library in C# 3.0. It took hardly any lines of code, and covered a broad range of possible usage scenarios. See here, for more on DBC. One thing that bothered me was the fact that if something failed a check, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t tell what went wrong. I had a little free time today, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d fix that.</description>

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring old prototype code I wrote year ago. It always amazes me to se how my coding style changes over the years. It also intrigues me, because it&amp;rsquo;s a kind of cross between archeology and journaling. I can see what I was doing years ago. I wrote this little C++ memory simulation back in 2002, for a the memory component of a little CPU simulator:
struct memory { byte_t* mem; unsigned int size;``memory(unsigned int x = vpc::mem_size) { mem = new byte_t[x]; size = x; //memset(mem, 0, size); } ~memory() { if(mem !</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been learning more about the OWL web ontology language in an attempt to find a way to represent SPARQL queries in LINQ. SPARQL and LINQ are very different, and the systems that they target are also dissimilar. Inevitably, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to imagine the techniques to employ in translating a query from one language to the other without actually trying to implpement the LINQ extensions. I&amp;rsquo;ve got quite a long learning curve to climb.</description>

      <description>I recently posted a question on Stack Overflow on the feasibility of using IL rewriting frameworks to rectify bad design after the fact. The confines of the answer comment area were too small to give the subject proper treatment so I though a new blog post was in order. Here&amp;rsquo;s the original question:
 I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been playing around with PostSharp, and it brought to mind a problem I faced a few years back: A client&amp;rsquo;s developer had produced a web application, but they had not given a lot of thought to how they managed state information - storing it (don&amp;rsquo;t ask me why) statically on the Application instance in IIS.</description>

We are glad (very glad) to announce that the chances of us having a child with CF is something in the region of 1 in 22,000. Compare that to the odds that two strangers would conceive a child with CF which is something like 1 in 625.</description>

      <description>This time I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you the design pattern that I use for code generation. Generally I use this for analysis of hierarchical structures, such as assemblies or database metadata. You could use it in other scenarios, where data is less structured. If you are familiar with the operation of a SAX parser and .NET events then you&amp;rsquo;ll have no trouble understanding the design.
SAX-like Parser A SAX parser works by iterating through its material (in this case XML, but that&amp;rsquo;s immaterial) firing off events for everything that it finds.</description>

      <description>Last time I described typed and un-typed events, and multicasting events to several listeners. One of those listeners would be a code generator. This time I&amp;rsquo;ll go on to describe some of the necessary infrastructure that such a design requires. Generally this information is all about tieing the events together. The context in which an event takes place is as important as the event itself.
When you&amp;rsquo;re generating code progressively, you need to keep track of what you have done, and what still needs to be done.</description>

      <description>This time I&amp;rsquo;m going to describe the source snippet that I posted last time. In previous posts I showed the implementation that I use of the Observer pattern to fire off events notifying the code generator about code structures that it has found. The code generator was shown last time, and you can see that there are a whole bunch of event handlers that take note of the code structures and perform code generation tasks as required.</description>

      <description>Recently I attempted to implement a declarative predicate checking system to allow design by contract (DBC) within C# 3.0. I was not successful due to a limitation in the kind of parameters one can pass to an Attribute constructor in .NET (no lambdas). I thought I&amp;rsquo;d just follow that up with a simpler model based on extension methods.

      <description>The configuration of applications is a reflex action these days. Programmers assume the need for a config system without reflection and then move on to wondering howthey will implement it. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a bit of time lately wondering how many of these standard practices of configuration are ill-pre-conceived opinions. Do they deserve the merit that they have? I con&amp;rsquo;t help but think that most of the times I use config it&amp;rsquo;s out of habit, and the vague idea that it adds to my system somehow.</description>

      <description>Olmo made a very worthwhile suggestion on the LINQ forums recently. His suggestion was for a new operator to be added to the C# language to allow us to do away with the following kind of pesky construct:
 [sourcecode language=&#39;csharp&#39;]string x; if(a != null &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; a.Address != null &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; a.Address.FirstLine != null) x = a.Address.FirstLine;[/sourcecode]  instead he suggested a new ?. operator so that we could produce something like this:</description>

A parasite is &amp;ldquo;an organism that grows, feeds, and is sheltered on or in a different organism while contributing nothing to the survival of its host&amp;rdquo;. Sadly though, I must admit that, try as I might, I was able to contribute little more than a few (beautifully typeset) documents that were promptly applauded then ignored.</description>

      <description>I spent most of my evening converting Jena to .NET. Needless to say it was only at the end of the evening that I discovered that Andy Seabourne (from my old home town of Bristol) had already worked out how to use IKVM to convert the jar files into assemblies. I&amp;rsquo;m not bothered though; I produced make files (rather than shell scripts) that work better on cygwin. The best thing I got from Andy was his &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t worry be happy&amp;rdquo; advice that IKVM spuriously complains about unfound classes - you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about it.</description>

      <description>New scientist is carrying a story about the use of cord blood in the preparation of embryonic stem cells. When K &amp;amp; I saw references to preservation of cord blood around the hospital we thought that it was to be preserved for later use by the baby in the case of operations and anemia. Now I am wondering whether they actually want it for other people. In which case my eagerness is slightly less!</description>

I think that my facial expression may have hinted at the miasmic feeling of despondency and depression I felt at the prospect of having to wade neck-deep through so much pointless paper. I doubt I&amp;rsquo;ll hear back from them, especially after asking to see one of their documents to check the level of design they wanted from me - only to discover that there was none!</description>

      <description>As promised last time, I have extended the query mechanism of my little application with a LINQ Query Provider. I based my initial design on the method published by Bart De Smet, but have extended that framework, cleaned it up and tied it in with the original object deserialiser for SemWeb (a semantic web library by Joshua Tauberer).
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll give you some edited highlights of what was involved.</description>

      <description>Grady Booch seems to be back into his stride after his recent illness. In his most recent blog post (Thursday, October 12, 2006) he criticises the unscrupulous advocacy of SOA as though it were a silver bullet. He also points out that any successes of SOA were more than likely due to the application of Architecture, rather than Service Orientation. He points out that SOA is a platform specific kind of message passing architecture that capitalises on the benefits of web technologies to simplify message passing on the internet.</description>

      <description>This time I&amp;rsquo;m going to explore some of the issues I&amp;rsquo;ve found in converting the prototype over to work in a JIT environment. If you&amp;rsquo;ve seen any of my previous posts, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that I have a working prototype that uses static code generation to produce proxies to wrap objects that identify themselves with the DbcAttribute. These proxies are produced solely for those objects, so the developer has to know which items have predicates on them in order to instantiate the proxies rather than the target objects.</description>

      <description>The work is well under way now, and I have reverse engineering, code generation and configuration pretty much sorted out, with a bit of code generation to make the whole thing compile nicely within an AabsNorm generated nant script that will take care of building the domain model, base objects, interfaces, mock objects etc.
At that point I shall put a bit of effort into making some WIX installers to allow me to quickly set up a development environment.</description>

That is, a highly complex, high performance application framework, that maintains a state in a variety of very complex ways, that uses polymorphism and .NET in sophisticated ways, and that will be adversely affected if the performance of Aabs.</description>

      <description>The process of creating a LINQ query provider is reasonably straightforward. Had it been documented earlier, there would have doubtless been dozens of providers written by now. Here&amp;rsquo;s the broad outline of what you have to do.
 Find the best API to talk to your target data store. Create a factory or context object to build your queries. Create a class for the query object(s). Choose between IQueryable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; and IOrderedQueryable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.</description>

Do I say anything worthwhile in this blog? « Alec the Geek
Well, the short answer is an unqualified &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;.
The long answer (based on our own experiences) is that simplistic mainstream trolls or opinion pieces will attract more passing traffic than a carefully thought out, meticulously planned, thrice-proof-read epistles.</description>

Apparently, trading standards people in the UK have forced a name change on a Welsh product called Dragon Sausages. Now, anyone but a complete imbecile (such as a trading standards officer, perhaps?) knows that a dragon features on the Welsh flag, and all Welsh people will know this, thus not being in any confusion about the nature of the product.</description>

      <description>Funny. There really is a large Oedipal component to anti-MS zealotry. The non-alpha nerds (especially very young under graduate level or recently post graduate level nerds) presumably see Bill Gates (and Microsoft in general) in the same way as they saw their fathers when they were very young children&amp;hellip; Bill is the ultimate competitor for all that they desire in the world of their technical explorations (mother). If they cannot displace him and his organization from the affections of mother (the PC buying, technology using public) then they learn to sublimate their hatred of him into 500 word anti-MS blog posts on sites like slashdot.</description>

      <description>Aymeric put me onto a cool application called Neuro Programmer 2 (from the sinister sounding Transparent Corporation – makes me think of Umbrella Corporation), that generates brainwave entrainment sessions. We tried out one called Caffeine Replacement, and were quite amazed at the effect it had on us. We both ended up euphoric afterwards.
That got me to thinking, if you can entrain your brainwaves deliberately to give you more vitality and concentration, isn&amp;rsquo;t it possible to accidentally find yourself in an environment that has the opposite effect on you?</description>

      <description>[digg=http://www.digg.com/programming/Domain_Modeling_and_Ontology_Engineering] The semantic web is poised to influence us in ways that will be as radical as the early days of the Internet and World Wide Web. For software developers it will involve a paradigm shift, bringing new ways of thinking about the problems that we solve, and more-importantly bringing us new bags of tricks to play with.
One of the current favourite ways to add value to an existing system is through the application of data mining.</description>

      <description>Another masterpiece of the art. This one even includes a little error to help make the client feel not only blessed with good fortune at having found the elixir but also heroically perspicatious at having found that their grammatical capacities are as overdeveloped as their hair soon will be.

Thanks to Derek for this gem.</description>

      <description>Darren Neimke posted some interesting thoughts today about the way developers lose their drive on a project, and how it&amp;rsquo;s reflected in SCRUM meetings. He thought that it might be due to the SCRUM meetings themselves. Daniel Crowley-Wilson has another idea - the developers are just bored.
Developers relish challenges and opportunities to do new things, and solve novel problems. As Daniel says, about midway through a project, there is little novelty in the problems left to be solved.</description>

      <description>Perhaps the day has finally arrived when GNU/Linux seems like a viable option. Every six months or so I try out the latest GNU/Linux distros to see how they&amp;rsquo;re progressing. I look at them from the usual jaundiced perspective of the professional programmer. Not from the naive perspective of teenage rebellion. Normally I end up wandering off in disgust at the unfinished feel of the whole ensemble.
All I want is an environment that doesn&amp;rsquo;t fight back when I use it.</description>

      <description>Yes, like all the other gullible fools, with highly reactive immune systems, I have invested my hard-earned money in a mosquito-click (tm). On the tin it says that as few as five clicks will inhibit the histamine reaction and 10 clicks will also neutralise the foriegn matter injected by the insect, by denaturing any proteins in them through electric pressure.
Well, I should have guessed that if I suffered enough from the bites to pay $20, then I was gonna need a lot more than 5 clicks to eradicate the histamine.</description>

      <description>I am so proud of my little angel. She walked a full circuit around her room without any help. It freaked her out a little bit. Especially after she fell over and gave her head a nasty thump. As predicted, she has leapfrogged over the walking stage altogether: She went straight to robotics dancing.</description>

And to do that I thought I would provide a link to a beautiful painting that we saw when we were in Oslo last year (or was it the year before that?) This painting totally captured my imagination, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen anything as good in years.</description>

      <description>Thomas Petricek has written a very interesting article on the new concepts behind C# 3.0 (here). It shows the origin of many of the functional programming features found in C# 3.0 from Cω and F#. Having explored a little of the code that backs up the functional programming aspects, I understand that although the extension run with the basic features of C# 2.0, there is a huge amount of C# code required to deliver the functional paradigm to C#.</description>

This bud for a tree fern was about the size of my hand with fingers outstretched. It would be great to get a time laps of one of these unfolding. mind you, the humidity would have fritzed my camera way before it got through the sequence.
I love the fractal symmetry in the self similarity on each scale. I wonder how many levels of spiral there are in these buds?</description>

      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of LINQ in the last year or so, I figured that I could improve my C# 3.0 by improving my functional programming. I had two choices of language to explore: Haskell or F#. F# was the obvious choice, I&amp;rsquo;m doing this to be a better C# programmer, right? I don&amp;rsquo;t want to depart too far from C# then.
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to give you the whole F# tutorial (though god knows someone needs to, cos the manual is poor).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve posted a whole bunch (well 45) bugs on the GotDotNet bug tracker for enhancements that nORM should not have to live too long without. Some of them ought to be fairly easy to deliver, like changing method names to have a clean and consistent format. Others are a bit more of a challenge - like adding persistence support for XML documents and reverse engineering an entity model from a schema file.</description>

      <description>Fishdots v1 and its plugins were groaning under their own weight. It&amp;rsquo;s in-memory function definitions model, inherited from before it was even a fishy thing, led to some serious load time lag. Combine that with extensive use of tmux, and you have a recipe for frustration!
The repo fishdots2 ports everything over to use the inate autoloading capabilities of fish shell. In the process of the rewrite, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the chance to break it up, and make it simpler and more clearly focused.</description>

      <description>This site is entertaining in the same way that nonsense poetry is. It is ingenious, and its obvious that a great deal of effort has been put into it, but it is not intended to make any sense. I am also bowled over by how powerful the memes are to be able to force these people into expending that much effort in the pursuit of the arguments. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the poor souls compelled out into the rain on a Saturday morning to spread the word, despite the fact that these (seemingly respectable) people are being rained on as well as showered with the contempt of their fellow men.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been rooting through my old and slightly newer photos. You can see some of the usual and not so usual suspects in compromising or not so compromising pictures with more or less amounts of alcohol in their bloodstreams.
One thing I love about Flickr (which I&amp;rsquo;ve also come to love about GMail) is the use of metadata tags to describe content rather than hierarchical file structures. In here I&amp;rsquo;ve tagged it with the who what where and when of the pictures.</description>

      <description>I recently ran across a problem with data bound controls in ASP.NET, where I set the string formatting specification (by the book) and nothing happened. If you come across this problem you are probably missing the HtmlEncode attribute on your column specification. Without this the braces are probably encoded and thus the formatting string is unrecognisable to the control. Consider adding the []{style=&amp;ldquo;font-size:10px;font-family:Courier New;&amp;quot;}[HtmlEncode]{style=&amp;ldquo;color:red;&amp;quot;}[=&amp;ldquo;false&amp;rdquo; ]{style=&amp;ldquo;color:blue;&amp;quot;}to your binding specifications - it worked for me.</description>

      <description>Martin Fowler&amp;rsquo;s bliki has a very good post on what he calls the &amp;lsquo;technical debt quadrant&amp;rsquo;. This post succinctly sums up the difference between those who produce poor designs in ways that are contrary to their best interests, and those who do so knowingly and reluctantly.
In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve noted that many of those who profess to being agile are really just defaulters in the bank of technical debt. They confuse incurring inadvertent reckless technical debt with being Agile.</description>

The normal level is &amp;ldquo;General Arrogance&amp;rdquo;, and the only two higher levels in France are &amp;ldquo;Surrender&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Collaborate&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>Do you suppose silicon based life forms construct computers from carbon and then agonize over whether they will become intelligent?
A 100% crime detection and solving rate is clearly not compatible with most people&amp;rsquo;s notions of civil liberty. This implies that there are certain types and levels of crime that we are tacitly prepared to tolerate. What are they and how much. If you are still in doubt, how would you react to being compelled to provide a DNA fingerprint for a national database?</description>

      <description>James Auger in his controversial new book, Augmented Animals, envisions animals, birds, reptiles and even fish using specially engineered gadgets to help them overcome their evolutionary shortcomings. He imagines rodents zooming around with night-vision survival goggles, squirrels hoarding nuts using GPS locators and fish armed with metal&amp;hellip;
This reminds me so much of Ben Bova&amp;rsquo;s Uplift War, that it&amp;rsquo;s funny. I don&amp;rsquo;t think its an inherently evil idea, unlike those who believe that the word &amp;lsquo;natural&amp;rsquo; should be in capitals.</description>

      <description>It says here: &amp;ldquo;in the absence of nuclear receptor 2E1 (NR2E1), even laboratory mice can become fierce, displaying pathological violent behavior &amp;ldquo;.
It&amp;rsquo;s now obvious that the UK government has been manufacturing an NR2E1 suppressant for years and releasing it into the water supplies of council estates and spiking Stella Artois with it.
Do women undergo a drop in the levels of NR2E1 every month? [It&amp;rsquo;s just a joke, alright!]</description>

      <description>Short Answer: Yes!
Regular readers of the The Wandering Glitch know I focused lots of attention on LINQ and the new wave of language innovation in C# 3.0. I&amp;rsquo;m intrigued by functional programming in C#. At university, I focused on languages like C, C++, Eiffel and Ada. I&amp;rsquo;ve never since needed to learn functional programming techniques - who uses them, after all? Functional programming had always seemed like a distant offshoot of some Bourbakiste school of mathematical programming unconcerned with practical issues of software development.</description>

Functional Programming in C# - Higher-Order Functions  This is the second in a series on the basics of functional programming using C#. My topic today is one I touched on last time, when I described the rights and privileges of a function as a first class citizen. I&amp;rsquo;m going to explore Higher-Order Functions this time. Higher-Order Functions are functions that themselves take or return functions.</description>

      <description>This post describes generic programming and the capabilities of generics in C#. I conclude that C# Generics and C# generally are not able to solve issues that are easy in the Standard Template Library. Nothing would make me happier than if you were able to demonstrate to me that my conclusions are wrong. If thats true, please don&amp;rsquo;t keep it to yourself!!!!!
Ever since moving to C# from C++, I&amp;rsquo;ve missed the expressive power and elegance of the Standard Template Library (STL).</description>

      <description>This is me with Giganotosaurus, or as he is otherwise known &amp;ldquo;The Great Southern Lizard&amp;rdquo;, discovered recently in Argentina. He is a scary looking bugger. Where T-Rex would weigh in at about 6 tons of teeth and muscle, Giganotosaurus weighed at 8 tonnes. He had 15cm teeth, and was around 13 meters from the tip of his ferocious maw to the end of his whip-like tail. He could swallow grown men whole with ease, and could probably catch them even if they were in a jeep.</description>

One thing I am sure about, it will be a priceless resource for professional and amateur astronomers alike.</description>

      <description>In my notation a simple grammatical structure is represented as a triple of the form [subject | action | object] with elements of the triple annotated with gliphs to represent tense, belief etc.
One of the elements that has never satisfied me is constructions that are kind of three way sentences such as &amp;ldquo;john threw the ball to tom&amp;rdquo; which in the notation is represented as [john | throw_p | &amp;lt;to, tom, ball&amp;gt;] It could of course be written as two statements</description>

OWL defines two types of property: DatatypeProperty and ObjectProperty. An object property links instances from two Classes, just like a reference in .NET between two objects. In OWL you define it like this:
&amp;lt;owl:ObjectProperty rdf:ID=&amp;ldquo;isOnAlbum&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Track&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;rdfs:range rdf:resource=&amp;quot;#Album&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/owl:ObjectProperty&amp;gt;
A DatatypeProperty is similar to a .NET property that stores some kind of primitive type like a string or an int. In OWL it looks like this:</description>

      <description>My last post explored the implementation of the Where extension method on IEnumerator and IQueryable. I showed that the filter method on enumerators visits every element in the collection. I also showed that calling Where on a Queryable just adds a new root to the expression tree. I ended with a promise to show how the queryable gets turned into a sequence of object references. This is the really innovative part of LINQ - If we want to provide a LINQ-style query language on some data store of our own, we need to understand how this stuff works.</description>

      <description>Introduction In recent weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been decompiling LINQ with Reflector to try to better understand how expression trees get converted into code. I had some doubts about Reflector&amp;rsquo;s analysis capabilities, but [Matt Warren]{style=&amp;ldquo;color:#365f91;&amp;quot;} and [Nigel Watson]{style=&amp;ldquo;color:#365f91;&amp;quot;} assure me that it can resolve everything that gets generated by the C# 3.0 compiler. I am going to continue disassembling typical usage of LINQ to Objects, and will use whatever tools are available to allow me to peer beneath the hood.</description>

I went digging under the surface of the LINQ query extension and iterators recently - I wanted to know how much I pay for the simplicity I get with APIs from the System.Query namespace. This post explores a little of the implementation of one of the key parts of the LINQ system. I&amp;rsquo;m starting out with the System.Query.Sequence.Where extension method because it follows on nicely from the last post on LINQ and Reflection.</description>

      <description>I have been receiving increasingly desperate messages from various scions of once elevated families of the Ivory Coast, Kenya and South Africa. They have all these funds tied up and the need ME to help them release it (in confidence of course, but I know you, dear reader, will not tell a soul)!
I feel honoured to be considered for the noble task of helping these courteous young people out of their dire circumstances.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been five days already, and the urge has come upon me to write a blog entry to say what&amp;rsquo;s been going on.
Friday afternoon I got a call from Kerry saying that she&amp;rsquo;d had a &amp;lsquo;show&amp;rsquo;. Naturally I wondered whether it was a cabaret or the normal sort. It turned out to be a whole lot more biological than that, involving mucus plugs and contractions and Emily&amp;rsquo;s feet slipping down into the birth canal.</description>

      <description>A new &amp;lsquo;chutist had just jumped from the plane at 10,000 feet, and soon discovered that all his lines were hopelessly tangled. At about 5,000 feet, still struggling, he noticed someone coming up from the ground at about the same speed as he was going towards the ground. As they passed each other at 3,000 feet, the &amp;lsquo;chutist yells, &amp;ldquo;HEY! DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PARACHUTES?&amp;rdquo; The reply came, fading towards the end, &amp;ldquo;NO!</description>

      <description>Today I had record stats on my blog. I passed the 200 hits per day threshold.
{width=&amp;ldquo;172&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;148&amp;rdquo;}
Since Mitch Denny told me the kind of visitor numbers he got on his blog, I&amp;rsquo;ve been operating with a bit of an inferiority complex. At the time I was peaking at about 20 hits per day and at the time I was pleased with those levels. Since then (about 4 months ago) I have been trying to attract more visitors to the blog.</description>

      <description>The mind boggles at the possibilities of shapelock!
It is a &amp;lsquo;Ultra-High Molecular Weight Low Temperature Thermoplastic &#39; which is to say - a form of modelling plastic that can be made plyable at just above room temperature, and can be moulded to almost any shape, but which when it cools is hard as steel. Now I have my shed, (well I share it with Cockroaches and Huntsmen spiders and moths the size of mice, but I call it mine) and a double garage (not pronounced like Mirage but like Forage) I also have the opportunity (but not the leasure time) to get more &amp;lsquo;practical&amp;rsquo;.</description>

As a renowned Charitable Organisation I am now the first port of call for all such desperate people who, ridden with cancer and sadly widowed from a rich, industrious and virtuous husbands, need to transfer money out of accounts that work in very strange ways.

      <description>It seems I touched a bit of a raw nerve with Alec when I pointed out that some IDEs are less crap than others. Specifically, I was referring to the ones that have major corporate clout invested in their production. He pointed out that they require standardisation of tools within a development team as well as standardisation of APIs, SCM tools, documentation, and build tools. He also points out that they obscure information from the developer that is necessary for the proper understanding of a complex system.</description>

The client had a module that they were using to create a custom Principal object derived from a FormsPrincipal. I found that after I had converted the project to work with VS.</description>

      <description>It sounds like Daniel Tammet is anything but an idiot, but he is definitely an autistic savant. His insight into his abilities are described in this fascinating article in the Guardian.
Daniel&amp;rsquo;s facility with languages and figures reminds me of a man called Shiva who I met in Goa last year. Shiva is not not in any way mentally disabled, but he is fluent in 15 languages (last time I asked - probably more now).</description>

      <description>The graph below I found from a recruitment site. It lists the relative importance of programming language skills and how they have changed over the last few years.
Aside from the fact that C# isn&amp;rsquo;t even in there, which I find a little alarming, it shows that all of the languages listed are in decline. Especially my beloved C++, king of all languages. Does this graph indicate that there is a proliferation of languages and that the impact of previously major languages is being diluted.</description>

      <description>What is the ideal of good design?
There are limitless answers to this question. Most of them focus on the day to day business of writing software – and aim to minimize the effects of bad design choices through application of a simple principle. The patchwork of these principles when applied in a harmonious way is hoped to give health and vigour to a system. When you write software, you generally hope to extend its lifespan beyond the short term - to help it become a living thing.</description>

 Eradicate typographical errors from the development process. Remove source code from the development process. Move the emphasis of the development process from coding to design. Make the development process a visual rather than linguistic one. Move maintenance from code to design. Make debugging easy Make designs directly executable Make viewing levels of abstraction easy. Make moving from one level of abstraction to aqnother easy.</description>

I have never seen anybody do such unnatural things with a guitar. I mean he was fiddling with it in ways that seemed bound to produce an awful cacophony, but somehow in his hands, the guitar produced a gorgeous sweet complex sound, that complemented the rest of the band perfectly. Wow.
I have to say, though, that if we were playing Star Qualities, he would definitely be &amp;ldquo;50% Vin Diesel, 50% Gerard O&amp;rsquo;Donnell&amp;rdquo; For those of you in the know, that is a pretty weird combination.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m speechless!!! Not about the fact that people would give up their passwords for a cup of coffee. But that they thought that starbucks coffee was worth the price of a password. I mean, have you tasted that slop? It&amp;rsquo;s the weakest, palest most bland coffee in the world (generally about as interesting as VeriSign&amp;rsquo;s line of business).</description>

Despite having used a laptop at work for years, I&amp;rsquo;ve always kept a paper notebook by my side. I depend on these notebooks. I even purchased the whole UK supply of Paperchase&amp;rsquo;s 500 page, leatherette, squared, rounded notebooks. These beauties are un-dog-ear-able, perfect for UML diagrams, lightweights and relatively inexpensive. The supply in the UK was dwindling when I discovered them in Cambridge. Apparently the Japanese manufactured them, and the Americans were buying whatever stocks were left.</description>

This is used in the process of bonding and is closely related to the way that the rest of the brain wires itself up to perceive the rest of the world. Just as I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying for years - reality itself is the force behind congitive development!
Now, the burning question is - should Kerry go &amp;ldquo;au naturelle&amp;rdquo; prior to the birth so that the twins can smell her &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; body odours ;-) maybe even ahave a curry or two?</description>

      <description>This installment leaves the CLI behind to show how we consume a knowledge graph within our programmatic environments. The framework I use to work with RDF is dotNetRdf.
This is part 4 of an ongoing series providing a little background on &amp;lsquo;knowledge graphs&amp;rsquo;. The aim is to let software developers get up to speed as fast as possible. No theory, no digressions, and no history, just practical knowledge.

      <description>This installment moves beyond the simple graph model of RDF to introduce the modelling support of RDF Schema. I will go on to show you how using the W3C Standard RDFS imbues your data with another layer of meaning, and makes it easier for you to enrich your raw data with meaning over time.

      <description>This is sadly not one of those blog posts where I show you what I have managed to achieve. Instead it&amp;rsquo;s one where I ask you if you have a solution for what I am after.
When I was at university, my professor convinced me that the benefits of design by contract were worth the cost of the implementation. In every language that I have worked with ever since, I have implemented some sort of veneer over the top of the language to enable design by contract.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m on one of Juval Lowy&amp;rsquo;s WCF Masterclass courses at the moment. Needless to say, my mind is buzzing from the fire-hose brain-dump he&amp;rsquo;s doing on us at the moment. It&amp;rsquo;s wonderful to see someone so deeply in command of the technology, not to mention daunting at the sheer incline of the learning curve. He&amp;rsquo;s had some influence on the development of both C# and Visual Studio as well as WCF, so it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising that he has sprinkled the course with some elegant little language features that joined the dots for me.</description>

      <description>I have been entertaining myself (not others) by writing all my technical docs in LaTeX2e lately. The problem is that there is a dearth of quality documentation on the web. I get the impression that because LaTeX2e is geared towards producing beautiful print output the people who work with it are loath to produce documentation for it that is at once compendious, and in HTML.
Come on guys! The typesetting language is IMHO unparalleled, and I absolutely love to use it.</description>

      <description>Forgive the recent silence - I&amp;rsquo;ve been in my shed.
Frequently, I need some variation on the Visitor or HierarchicalVisitor patterns to analyse or transform an object graph. Recent work on a query builder for an old-skool query API sent my thoughts once again to the Visitor pattern. I normally hand roll these frameworks based on my experiences with recursive descent compilers, but this time I thought I&amp;rsquo;d produce a more GoF-compliant implementation.</description>

      <description>Alec has provided a few of the reasons he hates Microsoft. They all seem like sentimental attachment to other peoples litigation defeats… In honour of that, I have changed the colour of my blog for a day or two&amp;hellip;
I too went through an undergraduate phase of anti-MS zealotry, and adopted obscure platforms as a kind of protest (i.e. Linux, Java, etc) then I went out to work, and realized that as far as the relevance of my skills is concerned, it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether the standards I knew were de jure or de facto, just so long as they were standard.</description>

      <description>Imagine a secure way to host Docker containers with functions (like Amazon Lambda) on the Golem compute platform, combined with Lightning Network, a massively scalable payment platform fast enough to support pay per use billing.
That would be a VERY different kind of deployment and orchestration model. Perhaps you might submit a Kubernetes/Docker Swarm YAML file and a secure data source, and dynamically direct hosting to the lowest bidder.
What would security have to look like for this idea to work?</description>

      <description>Derek&amp;rsquo;s kittens are displaying behaviour that seems to be hard wired. There is a huge range of examples of linguistic capabilities seeming to follow a strict developmental schedule &amp;ndash; use of verbs, tenses or telegraphic speach all arrive at about the same age in children. Chomsky is the most famous linguist to claim that language, or core parts of it, are inate. His justification was that there appears to be a poverty of input in a child&amp;rsquo;s linguistic environment.</description>

Child Linguistic Development is a document that I wrote when I was at university on the stages of language development. Since Emily and Thomas are now a week short of 18 months it is time for Kerry and I to start learning about learning. I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten most of this stuff, so it will make interesting reading for me too! I&amp;rsquo;ve put a link in to kerry&amp;rsquo;s gorgeous new blog/journal, where she describes her day-to-day experiences of raising twins.</description>

      <description>I posted an article the other day showing you how to exploit the query capabilities of LINQ to do reflection over the attributes on a C# class. I want to show you how to exploit some of the extension methods in System.Query to make the code even cleaner. I used a method called Members that got all of the members in order of member type (i.e. fields first, properties next and so on).</description>

      <description>When I started implementing the SPARQL support in LINQ to RDF, I decided that I needed to implement as much of the standard query operators as possible. SPARQL is a very rich query language that bears a passing syntactical resemblance to SQL. It didn&amp;rsquo;t seem unreasonable to expect most of the operators of LINQ to SQL to be usable with SPARQL. With this post I thought I&amp;rsquo;d pass on a few design notes that I have gathered during the work to date on the SPARQL query provider.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been given a week by work to try to make some progress on the LINQ to RDF query provider, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to say that the query generation phase is now pretty much complete for SPARQL. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing what a difference a full day can make to your progress, compared to trying to get as much done as I can when I&amp;rsquo;m on the train.
Last week when I blogged, I had the rough outlines of a SPARQL query, but it was missing quite a bit.</description>

      <description>Progress with the LINQ to RDF Query Provider is continuing apace. I have been pretty tightly focused for the last few days, so I haven&amp;rsquo;t ad time to post an update. I&amp;rsquo;ve lately been working on a SPARQL query, which will allow me a much richer palette to play with. Here&amp;rsquo;s the current version of the LINQ query I&amp;rsquo;m using to test the RdfSparqlQuery class.

      <description>Thanks to the good work of the WIX team, in preparing a version of WIX 3 that works perfectly on Visual Studio .NET 2008 beta 2, I have been able to prepare the latest release version of LinqToRdf for download. This version has been (partially) tested using a remote triple store based on Joseki and Jena, and seems to work fine. I intend over the coming months to put together some more comprehensive documentation on getting LinqToRdf up and running with a Jena triple store hosted in SQL server.</description>

      <description>I should have brought the code up to date weeks back - but other things got in the way. Still - all the unit tests are in the green. And the code has been minimally converted over to the new .NET 3.5 framework. I say &amp;lsquo;minimally&amp;rsquo; because with the introduction of beta 2 there is now an interface for IQueryProvider that seems to be a dispenser for objects that support IQueryable.</description>

The issue only seemed to affect some machines and stems from the use of the GAC by the WIX installer (to the best of my knowledge). I&amp;rsquo;ve abandoned GAC installation and gone back to the original approach.
Early indications (Thanks, Hinnerk) indicate that the issue has been successfully resolved. Please let me know if you are still experiencing problems.</description>

      <description>little oberon bay 3 Originally uploaded by Andrew Matthews.
This is little oberon bay on Wilson&amp;rsquo;s Prom. Taki and I went there at the start of the year. It is sooo gorgeous to look at in this photo, and despite the fact that the temperature was up above 30C the water was bitterly cold and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t cope for long.
I think it may have had something to do with the fact that there was only open water between us and Antarctica.</description>

      <description>Prompted by Mitch Denny who was in turn prompted by Paul Stovell, I am also exercising my Smart Art prowess in the name of proclaiming what I love, declaiming what I respect, and mentioning what I&amp;rsquo;d rather sweep under the carpet.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always found the world of software development, like much else in life and the world of work, to be a dynamic tension between the utterly mundane and the downright dreary.</description>

      <description>Yes - the number of posts does indicate a weekend almost completely devoid of important tasks that must be completed before the end of the weekend. But I think that is the very definition of a good weekend.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a month since the last time I posted, and I have made a few changes to the DBC framework since then. I&amp;rsquo;m making changes now in readiness for release to GotDotNet or Sourceforge. So I&amp;rsquo;m just making sure everything is as logical and consistent as I can make it.
Firstly, I have completely rewritten the NVelocity template assembly to simplify it even more (as if that were possible!</description>

      <description>The real value of a language learning (or any other kind of learning) organ, as Chomsky called it, is that its most valuable output is the _capacity_ to be so sensitive to the environment that mental processes grow to represent it. That is, the diversity of environments that humans find themselves in is so rich and varied that a hard wired and inflexible capacity would be of limited value compared to a &amp;ldquo;meta-learning&amp;rdquo; facility that develops to represent the environment the organism finds itself in.</description>

      <description>A new study, just released, indicates that social-drinking lab rats have improved memories over those that do not. Researchers hung out in the same bars as the rats, asking them probing questions after nights on the [town]{style=&amp;ldquo;text-decoration:line-through;&amp;quot;}bench?
As an Englishman, I have been known to indulge, or even overindulge, in the past. But for some reason, that I can&amp;rsquo;t fathom, over the last year or two I have stopped drinking. Perhaps I just forgot to&amp;hellip; do whatever it was we were talking about.</description>

      <description>Alec recently replied to one of my Agile diatribes with a very interesting set of comments. His point is that no project will succeed if it is badly run. I&amp;rsquo;d be the first to admit that in some cases, I should probably have stood my ground or found a more stable compromise. But we have to admit that many project managers are likely to be less savvy or less principled than Alec.</description>

      <description>Just when we thought we were on the way to a new age of enlightenment and reason, along comes the X-files and makes gullibility fashionable again.
The truth is always available. Choosing not to believe the truth when the truth is obvious or verifiable is intellectual suicide. Just because Mulder and Scully are snappy dressers, good-looking seekers after the improbable truth that is &amp;ldquo;out there,&amp;rdquo; we must all follow suite. We must do it while having our colons irrigated in our own personal, natural, organic floatation tanks.</description>

      <description>I thought that since I have installed SharpReader (the best RSS news reader on the net) for Kerry on Carbon, I might upload a few of the feeds that I read daily for her (and you) to check out.
Take a look at this file. You may have to convert the file to have the extension &amp;ldquo;.opml&amp;rdquo; to be able to import it into sharpreader, but it should work eventually. Its quite cool what is being done with RSS lately, my meager feed collection includes feeds for the weather, for VSS checkins at work, for new jobs posted in Melbourne, blogs, gmail, photos from friends and of course news syndication - it even has newsfeeds of new newsfeeds.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking the new Visual Studio Preview for a spin, and it&amp;rsquo;s got some pretty nice new additions. These aren&amp;rsquo;t just the headline features that have been publicized elsewhere, but the thoughtful additions to usability that will make our lives a little bit easier. They should also help us to make our code a lot cleaner and less complex. We see the introduction of easy performance reporting and differential comparison of profiling sessions.</description>

Or to put it another way, it&amp;rsquo;s in a box somewhere. Anyway - to hell with all that!!

As a result, I was disappointed to discover that when stuff gets shipped these days, they give each other cakes instead of indestructible Lucite plaques.

My guess is they probably didn&amp;rsquo;t tie it to the back of a car and drive around the block either.</description>

      <description>There are real boundaries to thought, that are genetically endowed in people. People who formulate new ideas may be either finding something that was always possible to think in all of us, or they may be mutants! They may even be aliens trying to subvert our culture. We should therefore subject all innovators in all areas to an inquisition to make sure that they are one of us.</description>

      <description>Money is a medium of exchange that allows a society to be more efficient. If Society is viewed as an organism that seeks to minimise the wastage of effort, money is the perfect mechanism for achieving that aim. If we were to assume that an endeavour that gave greater profit was more useful to society than one that did not, simply because more utility was delivered per joule of energy expended, then investment by individuals, motivated only by greed, is the mechanism that is most liable to deliver the greatest utility to society as a whole.</description>

      <description>New age mysticism is a negative force in society, because it is turning people towards an aesthetic criterion for truth, rather than an objective one.</description>

      <description>An aesthetic criterion for truth (believing in what appeals to your sense of harmony or beauty, or believing because of moral dogma) is a primitive, religious mentality that hampers progress. It was responsible for papal inquisitions. It was responsible for the &amp;ldquo;final solution to the Jewish question&amp;rdquo;, the stupidities of anti-creationism, belief in crop-circles, and countless other idiocies and cruelties down the ages.</description>

Sad to say, but my holidays are over, and I’m back to work. I tried pretty hard to keep my hands away from the laptop while I was off, but I got itchy fingers towards the end so I had a stab at implementing a non-deterministic finite automaton (NDFA). I implemented it to give me an excuse to play with the C5 collections library.</description>

      <description>Kingsley Idehen has again graciously given LinqToRdf some much needed link-love. He mentioned it in a post that was primarily concerned with the issues of mapping between the ontology, relational and object domains. His assertion is that LinqtoRdf, being an offshoot of an ORM related initiative, is reversing the natural order of mappings. He believes that in the world of ORM systems, the emphasis should be in mapping from the relational to the object domain.</description>

      <description>But I do come at the top of a search for my own name (provided I narrow the field a little). This is yet another of the desperate attempts by people like me to &amp;ldquo;get connected&amp;rdquo;. What that means is adding my personal details to yet another site that will sell them to a spam-bot company as they go down the tubes in a year or two.

      <description>This one took me a long time to work out, and it took a non-latin alphabet user (Russian) to point me at the right tools. Yet again, I&amp;rsquo;m guilty of being a complacent anglophone.
I was producing a database installer project using WIX 3.5, and ran into all sorts of inexplicable problems, which I finally tracked down to the Byte Order Mark (BOM) on my SQL update files that I was importing into my MSI file.</description>

      <description>{width=&amp;ldquo;250&amp;rdquo;} This Toyota concept car seems to have adopted the Fisher-Price/Window Media Player user interface approach to ergonomics. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether the dashboard is a touch screen, but I love the idea of exploring the object model of the car. I also love the idea of being able to control the car using a touch screen keyboard. In this age of automatic gearboxes and speed limiters, there is no reason for us still to be pulling and pushing levers to control the car - it&amp;rsquo;s a technological throwback, a bit like when a plane&amp;rsquo;s ailerons were controlled by cables attached to the joystick.</description>

Because when you&amp;rsquo;re famous you can burn your bridges.
I happen to want to burn mine so much right now, that I could spit! What was I thinking? Tomorrow would have been my last day. It still could be, but I can&amp;rsquo;t just walk out, cos that would mean I might get a bad reference, which I can&amp;rsquo;t afford.

      <description>Andrew Cantos raised some interesting philosophical points in reply to my partially tongue in cheek post The Great Domain Model Debate - Solved the other day. As ever, my short reply turned into a blog post and this is it. Andrew&amp;rsquo;s point was that there is a metaphorical link between objects in a domain model and elementary particles in some physical system. The ability of these elements to take part in the wider system is often a function of their sheer simplicity rather than being loaded with complex properties.</description>

I thought I&amp;rsquo;d start with a lyric:
 That one&amp;rsquo;s my mother and That one&amp;rsquo;s my father and The one in the hat, that&amp;rsquo;s me.
 You could be forgiven for wondering what Ani Difranco has to do with this blog&amp;rsquo;s usual themes, but rest assured, I won&amp;rsquo;t stray too far. My theme today is the limitations of the object oriented paradigm that I alluded to in my post about mapping ontologies.</description>

      <description>I subscribe to the idea that religion is a kind of dangerous but eradicable kind of cultural virus.
If people give in to the temptation of the aesthetic criterion for truth, then Science should not blame itself for the continued existence of Religion. People are not yet strong enough for the &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo;. The problem still remains - some of the worst doxological aesthetes are philosophers. If they are not going to do the persuading, then we shall have to rely on the pathos of religious life outweighing the desire for self delusion in the common man.</description>

      <description>In Beta 2, MS have given ASP.NET web forms and controls the Cider treatment. That is - you are shown the design and markup views side by side just as in the visual designer for WPF. This is called &amp;ldquo;Split View&amp;rdquo;, and can be extremely useful - unless your page uses controls that don&amp;rsquo;t behave well in design view. In that case you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to want to turn them off.</description>

Thanks to Paul Stovell for letting me know. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what made the difference - only a few months ago, I was on page 1,000,001 for queries like this. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it won&amp;rsquo;t last, especially when the LINQ documentation team start releasing their content out onto MSDN, so I&amp;rsquo;m indulging myself in a little back slapping while I can.</description>

      <description>Derek bemoans the obscurity of his patent description on the ESO(?) web site, and the consequent lack of generated income as a result.
I say - tosh! Unfortunately I can&amp;rsquo;t say it in his blog, because it keeps crashing, so I&amp;rsquo;ll say it here.
Tosh!
If the patent site page is obscure, you should make it come out at the top of the google listings&amp;hellip; by doing that you raise it&amp;rsquo;s profile without relying on passing traffic on the ESO site.</description>

      <description>I recently used Matthew Podwyszocki&amp;rsquo;s pattern matching classes for a top level exception handler in an App I&amp;rsquo;m writing. Matthew&amp;rsquo;s classes are a really nice fluent interface attaching predicates to functions generating results. I used it as a class factory to select between handlers for exceptions. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of how I used it:
ExceptionHandler handler = ex.Match() // . . . .With(e =&amp;gt; e.GetType().Equals(typeof(SoapException)), e=&amp;gt; new ReallocateEndpointHandler() as ExceptionHandler) .</description>

I couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree with his observations more. The problems he observes are problems that arise in on-shored and near-shored development models as well. They are inherent weaknesses of Agile.</description>

I think it will change the way I use my camera. With this interface I will still have to compose pictures that stand alone, since each picture is rendered alone on the screen.</description>

I fall firmly in the camp of those who think such a development is a mark of progress and a step towards realising the dream of free access to high quality ideas and well-thought-out commentary that will support the growth of civilisation in this increasingly dark age that we inhabit.</description>

      <description>A couple of posts ago, I said I&amp;rsquo;d explore the issues of code generation, DBC and ORM. The first thing I wanted to do is address the issue of &amp;lsquo;policy vs configuration&amp;rsquo;. Every project has to address this issue in some way, most systems are developed on a platform that varies from its deployment environment. Most software must be tailored to behave differently on different platforms. Typically, a developer environment is different from a production environment, with some resources replaced by mock objects or stubs.</description>

      <description>The last time I gave some thought to some of the limitations of configuration systems, I was concerned that people use configuration without thought about the consequences. Configuration seems to be a solution of first resort. I was trying to argue that that is probably an unwarranted strategy. It needs to be thought out. I argued in favour of a limitation on configuration. The points I made were:
 The implementation of configuration systems intrude into their client systems unnecessarily.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working on a series of blog posts that require me to reverse engineer the contents of the LINQ assembly System.Query. My experience has largely been very positive, but I have one problem that has slowed my progress – navigating beyond polymorphic method calls. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem with LINQ (it uses polymorphism in a number of key places) it&amp;rsquo;s a problem with code reading generally.
I find that while abstraction frameworks are essential to allow clean factoring and decoupling of object models, they make interpretation of runtime behaviour very hard – the more fully encapsulated a framework is, the harder it is to read it&amp;rsquo;s code and deduce how it works.</description>

 “New sources of value are laying the groundwork for an entirely new media value chain; one which leverages micromedia to deliver personalized, post-branded attentionstreams of chunked and microchunked disposable and essential media to communities of connected yet ever more hyperpolarized consumers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been using PostSharp 1.5 (Laos) to implement various features such as logging, tracing, API performance counter recording, and repeatability on the softphone app I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing. Previously, we&amp;rsquo;d been either using hand-rolled code generation systems to augment the APIs with IDisposable-style wrappers, or hand coded the wrappers within the implementation code. The problem was that by the time we&amp;rsquo;d added all of the above, there were hundreds of lines of code to maintain around the few lines of code that actually provided a business benefit.</description>

      <description>In a previous post, I kinda outed myself as a lover of &amp;ldquo;find | xargs&amp;rdquo; and grep. It seems that I inadvertantly gave offence to Jeffrey Snover (the architect of powershell), for whom I have great respect. So I thought I ought to set the record straight.
I like powershell a lot, and I suspect that it was familiarity with Unix that drove me back to Cygwin. I was truly inspired by the Channel9 interview that Jeffrey Snover gave.</description>

      <title>Predicates and Expressions - Part 1</title>

      <description>The predicates that are used to specify the in, out and inv conditions on a component need to follow certain rules. The first and least obvious is that it must follow the syntax and semantic rules of the C# language. I say that it is the least obvious, since it seems to be conventional to invent a new predicate language for these purposes. I can see the point of this, since it would allow a tailor made language to be used, and to extend it beyond the capabilities of a normal C# expression.</description>

      <description>Last time I started discussing the expression language used to define predicates on types and members. My conclusions were:
 C# expression syntax used since code must be transformed to that in the end, and the more similar the syntaxes of the expression language - the easier the transformation will be. No side-effects. Side effect within the predicates complicate the tasks of determining whether a temporal comparison is actually effective. If the snapshots can&amp;rsquo;t be guaranteed to be faithful representations of the state before and after the test, then you can&amp;rsquo;t trust the tests, and you might as well not have bothered with them in the first place.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve finally hit on the perfect combination of tools, that produces documents ideally suited to 6&amp;quot; eInk ebook readers like my BeBook. The tool chain involves using GutenMark to convert the file into LaTeX and then TeXworks to modify the geometry and typography of the LaTeX file to suit the dimensions of the document to suit the small screen of the BeBook, then MiKTeX to convert the resultant LaTeX files into PDF (using pdfLaTeX).</description>

      <description>Last year, a company called DWave Systems announced their quantum computer (the &amp;lsquo;Orion&amp;rsquo;) - another milestone on the road to practical quantum computing. Their controversial claims seem worthy in their own right but they are particularly important to the semantic web (SW) community. The significance to the SW community was that their quantum computer solved problems akin to Grover&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm speeding up queries of disorderly databases.
Semantic web databases are not (completely) disorderly and there are many ways to optimize the search for matching triples to a graph pattern.</description>

      <description>Marcello Cantos commented on my recent post about the ways in which RDF can transcend the object-oriented model. He posed the question of what things RDF can represent more easily than the relational model. I know Marcello is a very high calibre software engineer, so it&amp;rsquo;s not just an idle question from a relational dinosaur, but a serious question from someone who can push the envelope far with a relational database.</description>

      <description>For a client and server to talk securely with message level encryption, they both require certificates to encrypt and decrypt messages from the other. Those certificates need to be produced and installed on each machine. This post shows how that can be done, and what settings are required to work with the certificates. Thanks to Mitch Denny, who wrote a very good post on the use of certificates, which helped a lot more than some of the official documentation.</description>

The news report highlighted the fact that this could herald a new generation of autonomous robots that can learn to adapt to the harsh environments that they would experience on Mars for example. I was more impressed by the solution that the researchers had developed. The robot maintains a &amp;lsquo;self image&amp;rsquo; which it monitors.</description>

      <description>The semantic web is a GOOD THING by definition - anything that enables us to create smarter software without also having to create Byzantine application software must be a step in the right direction. The problem is - many people have trouble translating the generic term &amp;ldquo;smarter&amp;rdquo; into a concrete idea of what they would have to do to achieve that palladian dream. I think a few concrete ideas might help to firm up people&amp;rsquo;s understanding of how the semantic web can help to deliver smarter products.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve already had some very interesting questions and some excellent detailed and thoughtful responses. I thought, on Egon&amp;rsquo;s instigation, to bring together, from the site&amp;rsquo;s BI stats, some of the highlights of last week.
The best loved question this week came from Jerven Bolleman who wanted to know whether there was a &amp;ldquo;Simple CLI useable OWL Reasoner&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>This little script uses the JQuery getScript command, enforcing sequential loading order to ensure script dependencies are honoured:
function LoadScriptsSequentially(scriptUrls, callback) { if (typeof scriptUrls == &#39;undefined&#39;) throw &amp;quot;Argument Error: URL array is unusable&amp;quot;; if (scriptUrls.length == 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; typeof callback == &#39;function&#39;) callback(); $.getScript(scriptUrls.shift(), function() { LoadScriptsSequentially(scriptUrls, callback); }); }  Here&amp;rsquo;s how you use it:
function InitialiseQueryFramework(runTests) { LoadScriptsSequentially([ &amp;quot;/js/inheritance.js&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;/js/expressions.js&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;/js/refData.js&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;/js/queryRenderer.js&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;/js/sha1.js&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;/js/queryCache.js&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;/js/unit-tests.js&amp;quot;], function() { queryFramework = new QueryManager(&amp;quot;#query&amp;quot;); if (runTests) RunTestSuite(); }); }  I love java script now and can&amp;rsquo;t understand why I avoided it for years.</description>

      <description>{width=&amp;ldquo;244&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;343&amp;rdquo;}For the non-Java developer, like me, setting up and configuring SDB can be tricky. While it&amp;rsquo;s fresh in my mind I&amp;rsquo;ll commit it to blog so that those who come after will not tear their hair out like I just did.
SDB sits below Jena providing it with database support for a triple store rather than the more restrictive RDF XML file. The benefits of using a database are obvious, but the difficulties are not.</description>

      <description>Like a faithless lover, I went off to sample the market of feed aggregators - I was off having a fling with Omea Reader, , leaving SharpReader to languish in a distant directory of rejection. Omea was new and exciting, but sadly was a little bit slow. Pity really, because Omea is produced by Jetbrains, makers of the indispensible Resharper, without which my life would be a barren waste of multiple edits.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been glancing at the HtmlElement class in Silverlight today. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice system, but it&amp;rsquo;s clearly a work in progress. Everything I&amp;rsquo;ve said in the past about lumping all of your object model into a single class applies to this. The thing that irritated me was that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been hard for the Silverlight 1.1 team to make the developer experience more palatable even if they were using the one class under the hood.</description>

      <description>[digg=http://digg.com/design/Singleton_the_most_overused_pattern]Recently within Readify we&amp;rsquo;ve been discussing the results of some code reviews we&amp;rsquo;d done with some of our clients. One issue that came to light was the issues introduced by the excessive use of the singleton pattern. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with patterns, it&amp;rsquo;s quite simple. Patterns are a kind of reusable design. The original and most famous book (commonly called the Gang of Four book or just GoF) was itself inspired by the Pattern Language book by Christopher Alexander.</description>

      <description>No, not display themes in my blog. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start some new themes on design and development issues. There&amp;rsquo;s a few things that I felt I ought to give a systematic treatment to. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few conversations lately that brought my mind back to the issues of code generation and its related patterns. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been playing with generic algorithms in C# 2.0 for type introspection in my DBC system.</description>

      <description>Eric Gunnerson, has a very true post about how many of those who manage or participate in software development have caught the &amp;lsquo;lets post-modernise our language to pretend we&amp;rsquo;re innovating, rather then give an extra effort to clarify our thinking&amp;rsquo; bug. Lately, I have been bending poor Kerry&amp;rsquo;s ear about this to the extent that I am now categorised as a grumpy old man. Not that I care what the world thinks, but I think that language has more value if it is clear.</description>

It seems to me that it might be able to refresh an existing blog entry on wordpress, but beyond that it reports false positives. Of course, if you read this post, then you can disregard all of the above as blatant slander.
Update: yes, word posts OK to Wordpress, but it uses the default value for DateTime jan 1st 1970.</description>

The Semantic Web, a knowledge-centric model for the Web&amp;rsquo;s future, supplements human-readable documents and XML message formats with data that can be understood and processed by machines. SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) is to the semantic Web as SQL is to a relational database. It allows applications to make sophisticated queries against distributed RDF databases, and is widely supported by many competing frameworks. This tutorial demonstrates its use through the example of a team tracking and journaling system for a virtual company.</description>

      <description>Today I got my first experience of being caught in a storm of golf ball sized hailstones. We&amp;rsquo;d decided to take the day out and visit the Moomba Festival in the city centre. All was well, and the kids were in a cub scouts arena trying their hands at rock climbing. Suddenly, we heard an ominous rumbling and within seconds we were pelted with inch thick hailstones.
We quickly caught the kids as they fell off the climbing wall, and nobly covered them with our bodies as we hurried them into the canvas awnings that the scoutleaders had erected earlier in the day.</description>

      <description>Recently, Søren Skovsbøll wrote a excellent follow up to a little post I did a while back on using C# 3.0 expression trees for representing predicates in design by contract. The conclusion of that series was that C# was inadequate in lots of ways to the task of doing design by contract. Having said that, you can still achieve a lot using serialisation of object states and storage of predicates for running before and after a scope.</description>

      <description>Software Engineering is a discipline, not a science. It takes more than mild (in)competence with a sophisticated tool to be scientist.
Software Engineering is a discipline, not an alchemy. All alchemists found meddling in my chosen discipline shall be flayed to within an inch of their sorry lives and then viciously prodded until they renounce their wrongly assumed status.
Software Engineering has much to learn from the rigours of the scientific method, and science has much to heed from the mistakes of software engineering.</description>

Even though I don&amp;rsquo;t need to explain which scams to those of you who read this - they are proverbial - there are unspeakably avaricious and gullible cretins out there who still send their money into the Nigerian black economy.
I suppose if these people are moronic enough to think that the son/daughter of the Nigerian Mister for transport/embezzlement/finance would single them out from the billions of other candidates to share their booty with, then they deserve what they get.</description>

In a source file if you create a breakpoint, you get offered a &amp;lsquo;When Hit&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; menu option.
{width=&amp;ldquo;205&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;210&amp;rdquo;}
When you click on that you get the following dialog box allowing you to create a breakpoint that does debug window logging!</description>

      <description>The future of search lies in finding ways to bypass search engines altogether. Where information exists locally to make sense of what you’re after it’ll be used to create better searches. Data mining will be used to form a picture of what results go together, and what meanings a user attaches to a word. Alternative, unambiguous entry points to the web, like spatial search, will provide alternative, quicker routes to data for compatible hand-held devices.</description>

      <description>In almost every version 1.0 system I design, I end up endlessly rehearsing the pros and cons of different implementations of the domain model (or lack of it). It&amp;rsquo;s getting so tedious that I recently decided to answer the question to my own satisfaction. I produced a spreadsheet with as many design factors that I could think of and the different models that I have worked with or considered over the years.</description>

      <description>I recently got this excellent comment from Jeff Grigg on my domain model debate article. I started to reply with a comment, but the reply got to the point where it became a bit of a blog post in its own right, so I thought it worth giving it first class status. Jeff wrote this:
 Interesting concept: I particularly like the concept of using numeric weights and rankings, rather than just claims of preference.</description>

      <description>Several years ago, I worked on a contract in Central London (That&amp;rsquo;s in Great Britain, an island off the coast of America) and I used to commute to work by train (that&amp;rsquo;s a bit like a long chauffeur-driven car on rails). Every few weeks or so, people used to commit suicide by hurling themselves under the trains. Generally, these terminal events took place in or around the Crawley or Hayward&amp;rsquo;s Heath areas.</description>

      <description>I did a quick search on the new Google trends service, for the word &amp;lsquo;algorithm&amp;rsquo;.
The top 6 cities out of the top 10, were in india.
Perhaps I should move to India. they get to use algorithms there!
Either way, it seems that that would be a fair indicator of the fact that western developers are writing less low level code than the indians? Either that or the india programmers need to refer to the web for help more often.</description>

      <description>The executive summary is that we will have computing capacity to handle whole brain simulations by around 2020, and that Moores law applies to functional brain mapping as well as to processors.
 &amp;ldquo;I figure we need about 10 quadrillion calculations a second to provide a functional equivalent to all the regions of the brain. IBM&amp;rsquo;s Blue Gene/L computer is already at 100 trillion. If we plug in the semiconductor industry&amp;rsquo;s projections, we can see that 10 quadrillion calculations a second will be available for $1,000 by around 2020.</description>

      <description>One in 20 of UK internet users say they have lost money through online scams, a poll for service provider AOL finds.
These people are those on the very far left of the bell curve. Here&amp;rsquo;s an interesting calculation. How many people in the world have access to email? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but lets assume about 1B. 1 in twenty of those represents a figure of 20M. If I could get a dollar from each of these people, I would be rich indeed.</description>

      <description>I recently attended Juval Lowy&amp;rsquo;s WCF Master class course in Sydney, and in the introduction to the course Juval made some really interesting observations about the origins and justifications of Service Oriented Architecture. I was reading over the notes I took the other day, and I thought they were worthy of a blog post. Thanks go to Juval for making the course entertaining with so many quotable observations. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to relay them here as he said them.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a believer in the power of good advertising, which is why I was so pleased to see this fantastic example of the art in Melbourne this week.  It has it all - it has the doleful situation of the foolish dolt who has so willfully left himself in a state of baldness that is, as we can see by the &amp;ldquo;after&amp;rdquo; photo, so obviously reversible. I salute this masterpiece of modern advertising, and hope that television advertisers can learn from it.</description>

I finally grew irritated with not being able to categorise my blog entries. So I&amp;rsquo;ve moved over to Wordpress, which in some ways is not as good as Blogger (esp the WYSIWYG editing) but blogger broke down the other day, and precipitated this fickle blogger to jump ship. Doubtless I&amp;rsquo;ll be back, but in the meantime I&amp;rsquo;ll be found at http://aabs.wordpress.com/ and if you are Web2.</description>

I think I may have traumatized Thomas&#39; the other day - I&amp;rsquo;ve convinced him that Daddy&amp;rsquo;s head may explode without warning.
It was during bath-time. I covered my face in bubbles which they both thought was hilarious, if a bit strange.</description>

      <description>The initial design that I used when I made the ancestor of norm was based upon designs by Scott Ambler - The initial intent of Ambler&amp;rsquo;s designs was definitely to provide an abstraction around the logic of a relational database. What I want to do with norm is to abstract the very notion of a data structure. When we persist an object into a row on a RDB it is almost irrelevant that the data is persistent.</description>

      <description>Some time back I wrote a quote of the day: There is no greater joy than soaring high on the wings of your dreams, except maybe the joy of watching a dreamer who has nowhere to land but in the ocean of reality. For a moment I though the quote was apropos for Alec Clew&amp;rsquo;s announcement of his apostasy, but after a moment&amp;rsquo;s reflection I realize that it&amp;rsquo;s not.
Alec wrote the other day that, due to driver problems, he was thinking that he may have to depart the sunlit pastures of Gnu/Linux to return to the dreary halls of Windows XP.</description>

      <description>C# in Orcas will provide a bunch of really useful tools for those who want to perform tasks involving reflection. The reflection APIs in C# are already excellent but with the new query capabilities provided by LINQ, Reflection will be a real pleasure. There’ve been a few excellent posts on the topic.
In this post I’ll show you how to use the attribute metadata system to filter types using LINQ. In past posts I’ve talked about the Design By Contract (DBC) system I used to generate pre and post conditions for methods on a class.</description>

      <description>I was wondering the other day whether LINQ could be used with NMock easily. One problem with testing code that has not been written to work with unit tests is that if you test business logic, you often end up making multiple round-trips to the database for each test run. With a very large test suite that can turn a few minute&amp;rsquo;s work into hours for a test suite. the best approach to this is to use mock data access components to dispense canned results, rather than going all the way through to the database.</description>

      <description>Last time I hurriedly showed you how you can perform the next step of converting a triple store into an ORM system of sorts. The purpose of all this activity, and the reason I left off blogging about LINQ was that I am working on a system to allow me to use LINQ with a triple store and reasoner. The benefit of doing so is that we should have a lot of the benefits of the modern relational world with the power and connectivity of the new world of the semantic web.</description>

I set up my OneNote the way that Rob from 7Breaths described in his great blog series. But I found that I still need a little prompting from time to time. So I found a neat way to shove OneNote in my face at the beginning and end of every day to &amp;lsquo;gently&amp;rsquo; persuade me to gather and process my tasks for the day.</description>

All the warning signs are there – you have to throw all your machines away, and replace them with several hundred thousand dollars worth of new ones. Effectively you have to ditch your distributed system and replace it with a distributed system simulated on a supercomputer. Wow. That&amp;rsquo;s Cool!!! But is it a good idea?

      <description>Wired has a very interesting article on strange or rare weather formations.
Here&amp;rsquo;s an example - morning glory clouds from Cape York, Australia.

      <description>Well there is so much to write about, that I thought it was about time I jumped onto the wagon, and told the world what&amp;rsquo;s going on in my life, and in my head. As the saying goes, the more that things change, the more they stay the same. And that&amp;rsquo;s certainly been true for me during the last few years. Change is the only constrant in my life lately (except for Kerry - Oh, and Mosquitoes).</description>

      <description>This brand new blog is where I (Andrew Matthews) and any other volunteers that join the project will post on issue involved in the production of nORM.
As the name suggests nORM is another .NET ORM system. The open source market seems to be flooded with them, so why release another? nORM started out life as a piece of infratsructure for a project I did a few years back when there wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything worth having in the .</description>

      <description>Consider this a joint opportunity to insert a lot of oblique strokes into a title and to resurrect nostalgically the good old days of spleen. What I expect is that this site will fill up with more and more expostulations of frustration and cataclisms of gleeful creativity. You won&amp;rsquo;t know whether to laugh, cry or puke.
My suggestion is that you do all of the above; but in textual format and in this forum.</description>

      <description>Oh Yea! Be it known that Nitrogen is to be taken to Tyburn tree and there hung by the hard-drive until all computation has ceased, then taken down and have its giblets taken out and rubbed vigorously with a binary level formatting tool before being paraded around the service pack update avenues for the edification and education of the operating system.</description>

 Developing a design by contract system for C# History of Design by Contract Code Generation Systems XSLT vs NVelocity  I&amp;rsquo;m producing a Design by contract system that&amp;rsquo;s in early alpha. It uses NVelocity, and declarative programming. It lets you write code like this:

      <description>Last time I said I&amp;rsquo;d explore the requirements on a DBC solution in a little more detail. I first experienced design by contract when I was studying object oriented design at Brighton University, UK. I was studying it under Richard Mitchell, author of &amp;ldquo;Design by Contract, by Example&amp;rdquo;. The curriculum was taught using Eiffel. Eiffel was (and is still is, as far as I know) the only programming language that has native support for design by contract.</description>

      <description>Monad is a next generation command line interface from Microsoft that is due to become part of Longhorn. The architect, Jeffrey Snover, is so persuasive that you will end up nodding and wondering how you lived without it in the past.
He has taken the best of bash, awk, perl, VMS-DCL AS400 and WSH command line environments and has merged that language with a native .NET object pipeline model so that the command line directly pipes around .</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;sometimes you get out your brill-o-pad with the best of intentions and it all goes bad. Nitrogen has had something installed on it that disagrees with it and performance is getting progressively worse. There are a few suspects: SQL Server 2005 CTP, VS.NET 2005 beta 2, and a limitless number of other crud that oughtn&amp;rsquo;t to be on there. I think that whatever it was it infected N via the settings migration wizard that XP uses to port My Docs etc between systems.</description>

      <description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a few requirements, and shown you how I am going to partition the problem, I think it might be about time to discuss some of our technological options.
I said previously that I had a serviceable NVelocity wrapper, that I could use for the code generation. I have other options too, though, and some of them might be better in the long run, than sticking with NVelocity.</description>

      <description>OpenLink has recently posted an excellent white paper on using LinqToRdf with Virtuoso and the Virtuoso Sponger:
 Recently OpenLink has been investigating LinqToRdf{#link-id0x20d8a248}, an exciting project from Andrew Matthews{#link-id0x21f48218} which aims to bring the Semantic Web to .NET. Because of their language bindings and heritage, existing RDF APIs such as Sesame, Jena and Redland predominantly favour non-Windows clients. Conversely Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s ADO.NET Data Services provides a Redmond vision of exposing data on the Web but has no support for RDF.</description>

      <description>Derek asked whether I was agreeing with Roger Penrose by suggesting that we are missing some fundamental key to the understanding of consciousness and reality generally. I&amp;rsquo;m not arguing that the brain can only be simulated by a quantum computer. I&amp;rsquo;m only suggesting that the &amp;lsquo;deep&amp;rsquo; problems always seem to be just over the horizon. There seems to be something essentially hard about distinguishing thoughts from the titanic amount of computations in the brain.</description>

      <description>How many times have you seen a piece of code like this?
bool shouldUseXyzService = bool.Parse(WebConfiguration.AppSettings[&amp;quot;shouldUseXyzService&amp;quot;]); if(shouldUseXyzService){…}
It&amp;rsquo;s a familiar thing to most programmers. And most programmers never stop to think about just how evil it is. In my last few posts I&amp;rsquo;ve been suggesting that we ought to be using something like this:
if(SomeConfiguration.ShouldUseXyzService){…}
Why is it better?
Type Safety. The key reason is automatic type safety. Type safety ensures that when you make a call to another component you get the data you are after in the format you wanted.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last went therre, and it was good at the time, but since then it has grown and grown, and edged past some of the other similar projects. It has around 533,000 entries, and if this is representative, then I think that Brittanica and Encarta are soon to be out of business.</description>

I spent years bemoaning the fact that the laws of physics didn&amp;rsquo;t allow the wireless transmission of power. Now it seems that I bemoaned prematurely. Researchers at MIT have a found a way to use inductance to power a 60W (think similar power rating to a laptop) lightbulb from a distance of up to 2 metres.
I know it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound like much, but as I look at my desk I can&amp;rsquo;t help thinking that a short range power transmitter would help.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;that flipperty gibbet is brillo-padding his blog again. Not content with the perfectly good one that he already has, he&amp;rsquo;s gone and changed it back again. But as I always say, you have to keep it fresh. Hence the reason why I changed it back to the old theme.
I hope you like it.</description>

      <description>The surge of religiosity in the US continues unabated. A survey from NEWSWEEK is the current cause of distress – apparently over 90% of Americans profess to be religious, and almost half reject the findings of science. Alarmingly, 35% of college graduates (the most educated of Americans) accept the bible as fact and believe that mankind sprung mysteriously into existence less than 10,000 years ago.
Less than one in ten Americans was willing to own-up to being an atheist – I suspect that as at other times when religiosity was in the ascendant, like the dark ages, there has been a danger of civic censure and communal intolerance of the atheist.</description>
